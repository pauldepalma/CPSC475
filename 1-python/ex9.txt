Where dips the rocky highland
From fernwood to the lake
There lies a leafy island
Where flapping herons wake
The drowsy river rats.
There we keep out stolen vats
Of berries and ripest stolen cherries.

Come away O human child
To the waters and the wild
With a faerie hand in hand.
The world's more full of weeping
Than you can understand.

From The Stolen Child, W.B. Yeats
