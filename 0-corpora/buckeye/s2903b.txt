<VOCNOISE> what's bad about where i work at <SIL> <EXT-it's> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not so much racism as <SIL> whereas <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you're my supervisor i'm just using as an example <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i do something wrong <SIL> <IVER>
they're going to come and ask you so no matter what you say <SIL> <IVER>
it's going be law <SIL> it ain't going come and get my story <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so that means <NOISE> <SIL> if you're working with me <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and you screwed something up <IVER>
<SIL> i'm the one that's eventually going get in trouble <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah but <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>

<SIL> <IVER>
and then she's the one that i'll be hearing you know you don't know what they're like <UNKNOWN> black ass and all this you know they're prejudice <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and all she's doing is yelling <VOCNOISE> about being <SIL> <CUTOFF-pres=president> their prejudice against her <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what she don't understand that's her damn job <IVER>
<SIL> it ain't my job i'm doing her work <SIL> she ain't <SIL> <IVER>
but she's yelling at everybody's prejudice against her <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work <IVER>
yeah that's what i'm saying <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
because i wasn't gay <SIL> but you <CUTOFF-n=know> know what i mean i <SIL> could care less about gay people but like i said that <SIL> was the way i was raised <IVER>
<SIL> yeah my <SIL> my way that i was raised if people burned you once that's fine they burn you <SIL> twice get rid of them <SIL> <IVER>
you know it don't matter what they are <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there was gays probably when i was in there like i said i <SIL> could care less <SIL> but <SIL> i don't really know about how they should handle that because that's a weird situation <VOCNOISE> but you know what i mean just because somebody is gay <SIL> <LAUGH-they> ain't going to come after me they know i ain't <IVER>
<SIL> <LAUGH-no_offense> but you know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yknow that'd be like you know what the hell <CUTOFF-the=they> <CUTOFF-the=they> <SIL> putting on some kind of gay raise to make you gay <IVER>

<SIL> you know that i know of because you can look in the lantern or some of these newspapers we read a lot of newspapers at work <IVER>
<SIL> but uh <SIL> there lot of gays but like i said they're just like regular people <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> you know <IVER>
<SIL> i'm not really am sure how to answer that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i would say more conservative <IVER>
but i might be wrong because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my answer wouldn't be that good on that <SIL> question no offense but you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> yeah because like <SIL> i think columbus is more friendly than most places <IVER>
you know like when i was out in california it was like they'd spit on you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
i was working out there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well back then i was working at a cycle shop <SIL> but i was in the service but i was working there <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't like the way columbus is heading <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> for a big city don't get me wrong you can get anywhere real easy in this town <IVER>
but when i say i don't like the way it's heading <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they're cramming so many houses and everything and apartments and stuff <IVER>
it's getting <SIL> so congested it's that's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what i don't like <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah i had a boat and i got rid of it because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i will not even go up there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>

what's really weird is <SIL> where i live at i live right by <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> right <SIL> i don't even have city water and sewer <SIL> i'm the only one on my side of the street <SIL> <IVER>
i'm the <SIL> only little one on my whole block <SIL> <IVER>
they're build two hundred thousand dollar houses <SIL> <LAUGH-everywhere> around me <IVER>
these people drive by look at my little house there in the middle of it all <SIL> <IVER>
with nobody around nothing but land <SIL> <IVER>
hey <IVER>
i don't know <SIL> that's the way i am <IVER>
well see that's like a big thing you don't understand when northland <SIL> shopping center closed down and all the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> where where i'm at <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they got so many of them strip malls like you're talking about with stores <SIL> <EXT-out> of them <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> you know and then easton you don't hear much about that anymore <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i've seen that <IVER>
<SIL> yes but there we go again you know that'd be better <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there used to be a place in upper arlington on zollinger road when i was a <SIL> kid <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it used to be called the arc <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you heard of the group the byrds right <SIL> <IVER>
they came and played there one time that was a <SIL> teen club <IVER>
like i said you have nothing like that for kids nowadays <IVER>
and at whetstone park they used to have shelter house in the summer they held teen dances <SIL> every <VOCNOISE> <SIL> weekend <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
and in the winter <VOCNOISE> they'd build big <EXT-bonfires> out there where the casting ponds was let you skate they have big bonfires <SIL> when you're done skating <IVER>
don't have nothing like that nowadays <VOCNOISE> somebody would fall through the ice and they'd sue them <IVER>
yeah but they don't have it <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> there ain't nothing else to do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well back when i was a kid they had battles of the bands at the mall <SIL> <IVER>
northland mall would host battle of the bands once a month <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> veterans' memorial would have it valleydale had uh <SIL> <EXT-battle> of the bands and stuff like that you know places where kids could go <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i just like because its smaller <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and i like the area it's pretty flat down there and plus see southern ohio's got a <CUTOFF-la=lot> lot of good places to fish <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> so that's <SIL> mainly it's probably more for <SIL> fishing <IVER>
<SIL> because i like johnstown <SIL> better <VOCNOISE> if you really want know but there isn't many places to fish up there well is that good enough
