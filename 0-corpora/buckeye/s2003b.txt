<SIL> through the woman's group and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not really but i think living in the bible belt as she did she was <SIL> living there ten years before she married <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh got involved in a youth group <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think that that was very influential on her decision and so she was married in the church all my other children were <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but yknow <SIL> she's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she is <SIL> going her own path and that's fine with me she's very good girl and she's very <SIL> conscientious and <IVER>
no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as <SIL> the rest of the children did <SIL> but no <SIL> i'm <SIL> i'm very happy and content with <CUTOFF-he=her> <SIL> her decision <SIL> yeah <SIL> very much so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in <CUTOFF-f=fact> as a matter of fact ironically julie the tulsan <SIL> she and her husband both baptists <SIL> they have both their children in a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool and it's a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yes it's it's a catholic school environment so it'll be interesting to see what evolves <VOCNOISE> from <SIL> the children's <SIL> <UNKNOWN> uh <SIL> attention to <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> <CUTOFF-g=?> the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so <IVER>

there is very definitely <IVER>
i think they've tried to to uh bring the laymen in <SIL> to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> more of the priest <SIL> the duties of the priest <VOCNOISE> but there's like the consecration uh of the bread and wine that <SIL> that none of that has been sanctioned <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they don't perform they don't <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-t=?> <SIL> um they're not able to give the sacramental graces for baptism confirmation <VOCNOISE> <SIL> holy <CUTOFF-com=communion> uh well they do holy communion <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but uh extreme unction matrimony none of those <VOCNOISE> uh have been delegated outside of the duties of the priest <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i still think that it's a good uh <SIL> i do think the involvement of the laymen is very important <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i don't have any <CUTOFF-qua=qualms> <SIL> i i mean that doesn't bother me a bit about women <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

i've never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women aren't priests is because they <CUTOFF-c=can't?> don't <VOCNOISE> show any kind of uh spiritual leadership <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i've never heard that said <SIL> and <CUTOFF-s=so?> there must be people who <SIL> think that <IVER>
well when they had to cover their <CUTOFF-he=heads?> i know all of that but i don't think that's really been <IVER>
um-hum um <IVER>
