right <IVER>
right <IVER>
well yknow my and my girls <SIL> there are certain products that <SIL> brand name like <SIL> uh one of them i know is the meijer <SIL> uh pudding that you can uh take <CUTOFF-t=to> for lunches which they do <SIL> and it's like edventure <SIL> yknow <SIL> adventure but it's edventure <SIL> well <SIL> every once in while hunts will be <SIL> the same price <SIL> and they'll be a coupon in the paper <SIL> so joyce will or joyce or i we <VOCNOISE> we trade she goes the grocery store <SIL> once then <SIL> next two weeks i go <VOCNOISE> and the next two weeks she goes <SIL> so um <SIL> she'll uh <CUTOFF-sh=she> yknow she'll buy stuff like that with a coupon and she goes <SIL> and i go why are you buying that and she goes <SIL> it was cheaper than the <SIL> meijer brand <SIL> and then when we <SIL> eat it <SIL> it's like <SIL> it's too sweet <SIL> yknow or it's too overpowering or too sugary <SIL> and the girls even they the same way they would go we don't like this it's too chocolatey <SIL> so yknow like the manwich stuff it's like they just <SIL> pour sugar in it i guess because that's what people like and so i find that <SIL> the unbrand stuff well not unbrand but <SIL> it's all like a meijer brand or something like that or food club or something like that <SIL> <IVER>
