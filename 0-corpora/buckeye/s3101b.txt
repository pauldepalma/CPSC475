<SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> our belief is that <VOCNOISE> it didn't <SIL> it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it needed to be restored <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-an=and> <VOCNOISE> and we believe i don't know if you've heard about joseph smith <VOCNOISE> or <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well we believe that <SIL> um <SIL> that revelation <VOCNOISE> that was there on earth <VOCNOISE> was <VOCNOISE> actually restored <VOCNOISE> again and <VOCNOISE> through joseph smith because he <VOCNOISE> had <SIL> a desire in his heart to know what was true and he prayed <VOCNOISE> and he actually had a vision where he saw <SIL> god and <VOCNOISE> jesus christ <VOCNOISE> and i know this is all really <SIL> i mean this is like deep doctrine stuff but <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> and he was told that there were <CUTOFF-nah=none> <VOCNOISE> none of the churches on the <SIL> earth were true <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> some of them had good things but they <SIL> their um <VOCNOISE> they weren't exactly hitting the mark <IVER>
and <SIL> that <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <VOCNOISE> it was gonna about to be restored again <VOCNOISE> and so we believe that the true church is actually restored again to the earth <IVER>
and it was through joseph smith and he translated <VOCNOISE> the book of mormon <SIL> with <VOCNOISE> help from god <VOCNOISE> and so that's basically it <VOCNOISE> i mean the book of mormon is <SIL> a counterpart to the bible <SIL> it's a <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> from <VOCNOISE> prophets that lived in america <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so you knew you've heard about that probably <IVER>
oh okay <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> <IVER>
it's easy <SIL> to <CUTOFF-for=forget> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> it <CUTOFF-i=is> it's <SIL> it's american in the <VOCNOISE> from the fact that it's <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> it was written by <VOCNOISE> native americans <SIL> and <SIL> and um <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> and joseph smith was an american <VOCNOISE> and he was <SIL> used to <VOCNOISE> to translate it so it is <VOCNOISE> and it it's actually funny though but <ERROR-there'st=there's> <SIL> more members of the church that live outside of america <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> gotten to the point where there's <SIL> there's <SIL> more than five million outside <IVER>
less in america then <CUTOFF-the=there> <LAUGH> <IVER>
that's exactly what it <LAUGH-i=is> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
oh <UNKNOWN> there was a lot of discouraging things <SIL> just <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> i learned so much <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it <CUTOFF-w=wasn't> and it wasn't always just people rejecting you that was discouraging because that was kind of funny at times <IVER>
people would <SIL> <ERROR-you'n=you'd> <ERROR-dock=knock> on the door and they would <ERROR-yeyal=yell> <VOCNOISE> yell that they weren't home or something and <IVER>
and so <VOCNOISE> it was kind of funny but <SIL> but the <VOCNOISE> discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that don't have any <VOCNOISE> hope and <IVER>
they get so <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=?> <VOCNOISE> they're just so poor and they <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and you <CUTOFF-f=feel> i <CUTOFF-f=felt> <SIL> <CUTOFF-we=well> <VOCNOISE> we felt sometimes like <VOCNOISE> we could help them but <SIL> they didn't want any <VOCNOISE> help and <VOCNOISE> it was kind of hard to <SIL> just <SIL> say okay well <VOCNOISE> i did what i could and <IVER>
i mean <VOCNOISE> not saying that they had to believe what we believe but just <VOCNOISE> even just <SIL> the their attitude about life was so <VOCNOISE> down and <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> they were just so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
there was other things <VOCNOISE> right yeah <VOCNOISE> like we had our service we'd clean up <SIL> neighborhoods or <VOCNOISE> yeah there was a lot of different things <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no i think they liked that <SIL> it <CUTOFF-wa=was> it was really funny because here if you went into a <VOCNOISE> a <VOCNOISE> school or something and said <VOCNOISE> we wanna <VOCNOISE> help <SIL> we wanna teach a class <VOCNOISE> or <IVER>
we wanna clean or anything <VOCNOISE> they would probably say <SIL> yknow they might think it was kind of weird but they <VOCNOISE> would <VOCNOISE> let you <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> but they would be like you wanna do this and we don't have any money to pay you <SIL> oh but we don't <VOCNOISE> yknow we don't want money that's the whole point we're <CUTOFF-s=serving> <IVER>
we wanted to serve you <VOCNOISE> mm they <CUTOFF-v=?> they didn't get that at all <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> they were like <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> some people would just be like no no way it doesn't make sense <LAUGH> <IVER>
probably a little bit <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
there is yeah <IVER>
it'd be a lot more accepted i think here <VOCNOISE> even though it might be kind of <VOCNOISE> i wouldn't do that um <SIL> on my own but <VOCNOISE> if i'm <VOCNOISE> i felt like <VOCNOISE> that was what i was doing all the time so <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> full time <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
i think <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> one of the things that we <SIL> when when you're baptized is that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're really <VOCNOISE> supposed to <VOCNOISE> help other people to <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-na=?> <VOCNOISE> like if <VOCNOISE> if <CUTOFF-yi=you> somebody gives you a gift you wanna give it to someone else <VOCNOISE> but it's <SIL> easy a lot of times just to fall into the <VOCNOISE> yknow like <VOCNOISE> mold of <VOCNOISE> not letting anyone know what you believe and <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> so that they <VOCNOISE> think well what are those weirdos yknow they don't wear makeup or whatever but we <CUTOFF-we=wear> <SIL> we can wear makeup if we want <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> a lot of times people do fall in <VOCNOISE> to sort of <VOCNOISE> but i <VOCNOISE> i was not raised <SIL> mormon so <VOCNOISE> i have a lot of <SIL> my family and friends who are still not members of the church <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> also because it's so new to me that <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> am just <SIL> yknow i will talk about it with anybody and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> and i'm also <SIL> not afraid of people who aren't mormons because i think if you grow up like <VOCNOISE> a member of the church and <VOCNOISE> you might be <CUTOFF-af=afraid> <VOCNOISE> more afraid of people <VOCNOISE> that don't <SIL> believe like you've been taught <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> a lot of the <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> we don't <VOCNOISE> drink alcohol we don't <SIL> there's a lot of restrictions <VOCNOISE> i guess you call them restrictions but they're <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-el=health> <VOCNOISE> i feel like they're more <VOCNOISE> just health codes <VOCNOISE> just keep you healthy and <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it might be <VOCNOISE> it's like if we <CUTOFF-wu=?> <SIL> <EXT-if> <VOCNOISE> america <VOCNOISE> yknow we're <VOCNOISE> we're used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like <VOCNOISE> you might wanna get to know the chinese people but <VOCNOISE> you might not quite <VOCNOISE> be a little timid about <SIL> yknow <ERROR-stame=same> kind of thing <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i'm not i don't have any of those barriers <IVER>
since i've been <VOCNOISE> on both <VOCNOISE> worlds <LAUGH> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
and it really isn't though because <SIL> once <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because <SIL> i think it's actually it's really freeing not to have to drink and <VOCNOISE> all these things so you just kinda <SIL> i feel like i can get along with any <VOCNOISE> people <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> so it doesn't really exclude you from anyone <VOCNOISE> unless you would <VOCNOISE> let it i guess <VOCNOISE> and nobody's <SIL> perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so <VOCNOISE> getting over that is a <VOCNOISE> is <VOCNOISE> part of life <LAUGH> for <LAUGH-everyone> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no they were from all over the world i had <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> one <SIL> companion <VOCNOISE> who was from <VOCNOISE> russia but she was <VOCNOISE> on a temporary mission <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> uh mostly <SIL> all over america but <VOCNOISE> there was a girl from mongolia <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> there was <VOCNOISE> girls <SIL> there who <VOCNOISE> i never was companions with them but they were from russia <VOCNOISE> different <VOCNOISE> mm there was a girl from moscow <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> my mission president was actually from saint petersburg and his wife <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> they didn't speak english <LAUGH> <IVER>
you just get <VOCNOISE> sent <VOCNOISE> wherever <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
it's <IVER>
it's funny because i had studied russian but a lot of the people i served with were <VOCNOISE> fluent in spanish or something else so <VOCNOISE> it's like <VOCNOISE> i don't know why they got sent there but <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i mean we <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> really believe that <SIL> there <SIL> that it's inspired they send <VOCNOISE> our <SIL> your name and a picture and your <VOCNOISE> application <VOCNOISE> to the <SIL> prophet who is the head of the church <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> pray over <SIL> it and they <VOCNOISE> decide where you go <IVER>
so <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> and sometimes it'll take a while to get your <VOCNOISE> call what <UNKNOWN> they <SIL> we call your calling <VOCNOISE> or your call <VOCNOISE> but then you just it's exciting to find out where you're gonna <LAUGH-go>
