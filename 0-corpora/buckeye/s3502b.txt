<SIL> <VOCNOISE> oh no never have <IVER>
years ago there was a <CUTOFF-citiz=citizen> i don't know if you were <UNKNOWN> what your background is where you <CUTOFF-we=were> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ih=?> <SIL> were here but or not but <SIL> citizen journal was a daily paper <VOCNOISE> and it was <SIL> it was the opposite of the dispatch <VOCNOISE> was much more liberal <VOCNOISE> they used this and <SIL> it <SIL> it was a morning paper and the dispatch is an afternoon paper <VOCNOISE> evening paper <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> they shared the same facilities <VOCNOISE> the same printing presses and everything and then dispatch <SIL> when their lease expired wouldn't renew their lease <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and at least it gave you a lot different <SIL> view <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh but the dispatch <SIL> the only reason i get the dispatch is i do wanna know what's going on locally <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you <IVER>
right you <VOCNOISE> you you can't really ignore <VOCNOISE> i've heard people say i refuse to read the dispatch well you got to know what's going on locally i'm sorry <VOCNOISE> but uh <IVER>
the day your trash is picking up <VOCNOISE> what movies are playing <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but i don't really rely on heavily for news <IVER>
even they don't get facts right a lot of time <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh not very right on <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i would <VOCNOISE> twenty the twenty years the first twenty years i worked at the bureau <VOCNOISE> i was worked in statistics <SIL> so i learned a lot about <SIL> numbers and how to use them and <VOCNOISE> what you can do with them how <SIL> easily they're misinterpreted <VOCNOISE> and my wife <VOCNOISE> does it it has been a director of institutional research at the university <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> data <SIL> research <SIL> uh uh <VOCNOISE> they don't really have other kinds of research there <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
and she says <SIL> it's amazing you can <VOCNOISE> give these <CUTOFF-pep=people> give people numbers <SIL> and they immediately <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> use them wrong <VOCNOISE> they just don't know how to use them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh they <VOCNOISE> completely misinterpret even though it's very clearly stated what they're doing <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> the newspapers do that a lot too <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
people want a number <SIL> they don't wanna know the methodology that goes into it <SIL> or the the disclaimers or footnotes <SIL> they don't wanna read the footnotes they want a number <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> when i worked for the state one program we worked on was uh occupational employment statistics which was collecting uh <SIL> numbers employees by different occupations in different industries in different areas <SIL> of ohio <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> which actually used <SIL> originally started here the university in ohio it was a federal program department labor it was administered state level <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> it didn't <SIL> didn't turn out very well so they switched it over to me <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for a variety of reasons which is not entirely the university's fault <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they had to rely on confidential information which we couldn't give them because it was confidential <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> by federal law it was confidential we couldn't give it to them <SIL> but they needed it <VOCNOISE> so it <CUTOFF-ju=just> it was just not a good one <SIL> good way to do business <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and we would present information ok there <VOCNOISE> for <CUTOFF-ins=instance> <VOCNOISE> there's this this number of people in an occupation <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> but there was also a range of error on there where people wouldn't notice that <VOCNOISE> and they would take that number as gospel <SIL> and you just could not convince them that <SIL> well it really means more than that <VOCNOISE> uh the big one would be uh wage levels and we didn't really <VOCNOISE> at that time collect wage data so if we were kind of a conduit for <VOCNOISE> there's several different departments in the <SIL> the state <SIL> and the federal government collect <VOCNOISE> occupational data and we were kind of a conduit for the state for that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> people would they wanted an hourly rate they didn't want a range they didn't want <VOCNOISE> they uh they wanted a number and that's what that was gospel <VOCNOISE> but it's based on survey data so and and you know there's always statistical error in there and stuff <SIL> and <SIL> try to explain that to we spent more time <SIL> uh <SIL> when people call up and give information explaining <VOCNOISE> <SIL> this is what this really means then the just giving them the number <SIL> that we spent more time doing that <SIL> uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think a lot of people don't <SIL> understand <VOCNOISE> a lot of people don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a mindset <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> they don't wanna deal with <SIL> numbers a lot of people or they want something easy and simple <VOCNOISE> and that's what they're looking for <SIL> they don't really wanna know <SIL> what it means <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and a statistic under <VOCNOISE> any <SIL> <CUTOFF-ter=term> uh any <SIL> definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind <IVER>
and people <SIL> don't seem to understand that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh it's not like you're <SIL> collecting data for a hundred uh the the entire population of the entire universe you you're working with a sample trying to <VOCNOISE> represent the entire universe well <SIL> sometimes <VOCNOISE> it's good and sometimes it's not <IVER>
they tried sampling <VOCNOISE> well my brother rich was one of the families they sampled <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and it just didn't work <IVER>
and uh and the <SIL> data they collect is just <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> well i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but <VOCNOISE> the basic <VOCNOISE> <SIL> data has essentially how many people live in the household and what are their ages and race and that's it <VOCNOISE> and that's not a <SIL> i don't think that's a big secret myself but <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> i think <SIL> uh some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh <VOCNOISE> is is <SIL> colored by the fact that i collected data <SIL> for twenty years from <SIL> employers <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i'm a lot more sympathetic <SIL> to that sort of thing <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah just lot more sympathetic to people collecting data <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i had did one time <IVER>
i had somebody call and they were doing a survey and they wanted know what i did for a living and when i told them they said well we're done <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-we're> we're finished <LAUGH>
