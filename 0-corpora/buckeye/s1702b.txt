<IVER>
it's like oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
well i haven't read enough to know i <SIL> i saw uh <SIL> uh <SIL> uh preliminary thing that they were going to protest <SIL> and uh <SIL> but i don't <CUTOFF-a=?> i'm not <SIL> <CUTOFF-w=?> informed enough to give an opinion <LAUGH-on_that> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-r=?> i don't <CUTOFF-I=I?> that <CUTOFF-mi=might?> i think that that what they were protesting was that they weren't <CUTOFF-ge=getting> being <CUTOFF-i=involved> involved in it wasn't that part of their protest <IVER>
they weren't being represented <SIL> i don't know <SIL> i'll have to read <SIL> i didn't read <SIL> paper yet <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
no did you <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's probably because put your ad it was in the paper in the summer when we weren't <LAUGH-doing_anything_and_wanted_something_to_do> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> now we're busy <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh <SIL> i have just the same opinion i think most people have as the tv <IVER>
i mean i <SIL> i i mean that probably can be proven i don't know if anybody would do any <SIL> decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that <SIL> yknow it would be the influence of tv <SIL> yknow the <SIL> and then <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> another thing that's <SIL> well tv is the <CUTOFF-in=influence> <SIL> uh <SIL> where it comes from but like the kids are all into pokemon right now <IVER>
and it uh they have these fads that go through and somebody asked me my opinion about the pokemon i said oh brother <SIL> yknow <SIL> it couldn't be any worse than what was those turtles that lived in the <LAUGH-sewers> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-ni=ninja> ninja <LAUGH-turtles> <SIL> well the kids went into that just so <SIL> <CUTOFF-intensivel=intensively> <SIL> and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean what uh the visual <SIL> was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these masks <NOISE> and hoods <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and they fought a lot <SIL> and there was lot of violence <SIL> and then <SIL> i love walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i <SIL> i swear i haven't seen a walt disney movie that doesn't have violence in it <IVER>
i mean just like beauty and the beast there's extreme amount of violence in there <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow just every one there's a <CUTOFF-b=bad> <SIL> a bad dark side in the story so <SIL> children just are <CUTOFF-su=so> and i mean it's <SIL> in their <SIL> <CUTOFF-the=they> <SIL> and then <SIL> including my own daughter she <SIL> and i'd swear <SIL> i had her watch mister <LAUGH-Rogers_all_the_time> <LAUGH> but <CUTOFF-sh=she> <SIL> now that she's older she watches tv <SIL> she's addicted to <CUTOFF=d=tv> <SIL> tv something terrible and then so of course her children are <SIL> uh <SIL> so <SIL> but i think <SIL> yknow <SIL> i was <SIL> i didn't have <LAUGH-have> tv when i was a child child <SIL> and i think <SIL> yknow it <SIL> it stimulates the imagination in some ways but i don't know what direction that imagination really goes yknow <SIL> and <SIL> <CUTOFF-d=?> but there's a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody's face anymore <SIL> as matter of fact i'm getting so i don't watch the news <IVER>
i dislike i can't take any more of it <IVER>
<LAUGH> i seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder <SIL> it's like the same thing <SIL> over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> the yeah <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
yeah huh huh huh huh <IVER>
yeah <SIL> you <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ne=?> <SIL> uh i <SIL> yknow i've just come to <VOCNOISE> i always you know prefer for my children <NOISE> and <NOISE> myself i mean uh if there's anything <CUTOFF-d=Disney> <SIL> disney i usually go and watch it yknow at the movie theater <SIL> and after a while it's like <SIL> i think beauty and the beast is where it really came through to me it's like <SIL> that's a wonderful story but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it <IVER>
and the <CUTOFF-w=way> way disney sells i think is they do have beautiful music <IVER>
but then <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> it's like it <SIL> some <SIL> evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle <SIL> and then you go you can't stop and not watch that you <LAUGH-know> you <CUTOFF-ca=can't> <SIL> and if i was in charge of it i'd cut some of it out it's <LAUGH-not_that_important> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-s=so?> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um hum <CUTOFF-y=yeah?> <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
no asking each other opinions or anything like <IVER>
no kind of <VOCNOISE> of <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yknow <SIL> uh <SIL> it <CUTOFF-i=it> it just seems like our <SIL> uh society just has that <SIL> you have to <SIL> be <SIL> just horrible to a person because they're bad well <SIL> you and i know that a bad person doesn't become better by being bad to them <IVER>
<LAUGH> yknow what i <CUTOFF-mea=mean> <SIL> it's uh <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> we're i hope we're getting to the place we know that <SIL> that uh <IVER>
we'd <SIL> we don't necessarily overcome bad by bad we're still very much in that framework of reference in this <SIL> on this <LAUGH-particular_planet> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
okay <NOISE> drooping down <IVER>
<NOISE> okay <IVER>
<NOISE> i'm <CUTOFF-ta=talking> bouncing around too much <IVER>

uh <SIL> well i'm very much <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-m=my> <SIL> my baseline philosophy is thou shalt not kill and that goes really a long ways for me that includes uh <VOCNOISE> being a vegetarian <SIL> and uh <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> uh <SIL> most of our wars i would have <LAUGH> <LAUGH-said> <LAUGH-no> <LAUGH-let's> <LAUGH-not> <LAUGH-do> <LAUGH-this> yet <SIL> although on the other hand i <SIL> i have to admit that <SIL> there has been some stuff that we haven't been able to stop without it <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and <CUTOFF-na=that's> <SIL> and that's too bad yknow that <SIL> things things are <SIL> have been that bad in some <SIL> like <SIL> oh world war two <CUTOFF-th=the?> <SIL> i mean <SIL> we didn't really have any choice there not that <VOCNOISE> but uh <SIL> some of the <SIL> some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh <SIL> so but <SIL> yknow you can get you can get a philosophy but it doesn't have always apply every single <VOCNOISE> case you know what i mean i am against capital punishment the <VOCNOISE> the guy that they um <SIL> uh executed here in ohio last <CUTOFF-s=summer?> <SIL> fall did you know about it <SIL> you <CUTOFF-p=probably?>
