<ERROR-tutter_maw=tuttle_mall> tuttle mall around tuttle mall thirteen years uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh <IVER>
uh <SIL> i was going through a divorce parents <SIL> both parents passed away uh <SIL> my ex moved to saint louis didn't <SIL> tell me anything about it or foreclosing on the house and that's how i found out she moved and <SIL> just a bunch of <SIL> shit and <SIL> i just started uh <SIL> screwing up <SIL> so they wanted to <SIL> put me on probation and my uh <SIL> rebellious attitude or whatever said <SIL> i quit <SIL> was pretty stupid really but <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yknow what happened like in the same <SIL> year eighty eight <SIL> yknow so <SIL> but it was <SIL> it was <SIL> pretty tough but i just didn't deal with it properly yknow <SIL> i should've went and got counseling and by the way i probably should've got <SIL> marriage counseling but i refused to do that too so <SIL> but i didn't think i had a problem i thought she was the one with one <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
but she's doing fine <SIL> um <SIL> she was dating somebody i don't know whether they really got married or not yknow because i don't really have that much communication with her but <SIL> some guy younger than her and <SIL> i talked to him he seemed like pretty decent guy <SIL> yeah <IVER>
well it was rough <IVER>
not the actually going through it yknow <SIL> to me <SIL> it was to her <SIL> but the aftermath basically yknow you <ERROR-gis=just> <IVER>
at each other's throat for this that and the other and <SIL> and <SIL> yknow devon is uh my daughter's the one that really got <SIL> put in the middle of it yknow and <VOCNOISE> probably it was a blessing that they moved to saint louis because there probably could've been more uh <SIL> problems <SIL> legal problems yknow as far as uh <SIL> going back and forth to court and <SIL> putting her on the witness stand for stupid stuff yknow and <SIL> so <SIL> uh <SIL> in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there <IVER>
no i've never i've i used to uh <SIL> have an office out there that i visited all the time but uh <SIL> i've never been out there to <SIL> she actually lives in kirkwood <SIL> which is a suburb <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
so uh <SIL> that's where she went to high school and everything uh <SIL> but i had no i've never went out there <SIL> uh my my ex still has family here so <SIL> she comes back a couple three times a year and <SIL> i generally try to hook up with her <SIL> and <SIL> it's been a while but as she got older yknow she wants to be with <SIL> with her uh <SIL> playmates and everything as they get older yknow so <SIL> and <SIL> having went through that myself i understand that so <SIL> no it got kind of rough to have her here for a couple <SIL> three weeks out of a <SIL> or a month or something like that yknow during the summer <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
or they don't really give a damn that's the thing that uh <SIL> i've got i've got some friends that <SIL> with kids and <SIL> i see it like on the bus or with uh yknow when you're working somewhere and uh where you <SIL> people treat there kids yknow as a <IVER>
i mean i didn't have the greatest childhood i don't think any of us ever really had the best yknow but <SIL> but i don't <SIL> like i wouldn't <SIL> talk to my kid the way <SIL> some of these people talk to them <SIL> but um <SIL> one today yknow and she got on the bus and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the little girl went and set over here she's probably about <SIL> eight <UNKNOWN> <SIL> maybe six or something like that and she wanted to set here her mommy so she made her set with her which is cool <SIL> and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kid's trying to study her homework yknow for <SIL> not that well <SIL> i don't know was she up all night partying or was she up all night working yknow or <SIL> what the hell's is your problem <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> but the little girl's setting there going <SIL> mommy you need to go <VOCNOISE> help with seven like seven nine times nine's sixty three yknow and <SIL> her time tables and stuff yknow and <SIL> so uh <SIL> yeah i see <SIL> like younger kids to <SIL> with kids yknow and <SIL> and think yknow man your just <SIL> not only have you wasted <CUTOFF-y=you?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> <CUTOFF-s=screwed> <SIL> you screwed up your life you're gonna <SIL> you also screwed up your kids yknow <SIL> i was twenty <SIL> well i was thirty one when devon was born so <SIL> my ex was twenty eight <SIL> so we were <UNKNOWN> <SIL> both older <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not that that really helped as far as <IVER>
but i think it gave her <CUTOFF-so=some?> <SIL> and i wouldn't say i never got mad uh but <SIL> i've gotten mad at devon quite a few times yknow because i didn't like to <SIL> some of the things that uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she would either say or <SIL> or that she would do or <SIL> uh <SIL> but <SIL> yknow <SIL> i try to let her <SIL> live her life yknow <SIL> i think there's love <SIL> nobody can <SIL> teach anything unless you learn it <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah she went to school here till uh <SIL> ninety one actually <SIL> uh <SIL> so she was <SIL> let's see <SIL> about the fourth grade <SIL> fifth grade something like that <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> mm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think it could've <CUTOFF-b=been> i thought she'd get a better education out there <SIL> uh <SIL> now at saint louis school public school district she probably <SIL> district she probably would've <CUTOFF-g=got> had the same as here <VOCNOISE> but by being kirkwood yknow and <SIL> relatively small and everything <SIL> um <SIL> i think we maybe had uh <SIL> a hundred and <SIL> some kids in our graduating class yknow so <SIL> uh i felt i got better <SIL> attention when i wanted it <SIL> yknow <SIL> uh <SIL> then i would've at a <SIL> at a bigger school <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
yeah much too fast for me yknow <SIL> my <IVER>
i know the way we yknow the way we dressed and everything yknow it was kind of appalling to <SIL> to the parents and everything i guess maybe that's where <SIL> i'm coming from i mean uh <SIL> the way some of the uh <SIL> kids dress <SIL> yknow retro back to when with the bell bottoms and everything to us <SIL> and the uh <SIL> the piercings i just can't get into that yknow and <SIL> then some of the girls i mean they yknow <SIL> i mean my god they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at <SIL> fourteen six fifteen years old they look like they're twenty some years old yknow and that's what they want to look like <SIL> plus you watch some of these stupid shows on tv yknow <SIL> you <SIL> sit there and go <SIL> man i couldn't <CUTOFF-b=believe?> <CUTOFF-ma=my> my daughter don't do that yknow it's <SIL> when she's around me <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> never <SIL> when she's away from me i don't know what the hell she does <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
well i think uh <SIL> in my opinion i think <CUTOFF-main=mainly> mainly the uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it's> its the absence <SIL> of uh <SIL> basically <SIL> parenting yknow <SIL> uh <SIL> my mom was there <SIL> um <SIL> she was a housewife yknow <SIL> and uh <SIL> so she was she went to work after <CUTOFF-w=we> <SIL> i think when i was a <SIL> junior in high school yknow <SIL> and my brother they all my brothers and sisters are graduated yknow so <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> and that hurt her to go she <UNKNOWN-dx_ih_?=didn't?> thought she was letting <SIL> yknow neglecting me i was in <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
thought about it i've <VOCNOISE> come home get in the car and go out go somewhere yknow or come home get something to eat and <SIL> yeah that was about it i <SIL> ah but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think that has a lot to do with it um <SIL> i don't really <CUTOFF-n=know> <SIL> know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid and watching <SIL> howdy doody and all that stuff and <SIL> course it wasn't the uh <SIL> violent stuff maybe that you can see on tv now or uh but <SIL> i don't really think the media just hasn't had that much to do with it <SIL> it's just a different time now uh <SIL> i mean i remember <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast yknow with uh <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-y=yknow> <SIL> the vietnamese guy uh <SIL> vietcong guy getting <SIL> his brains blowed out on national tv yknow and uh <SIL> uh <SIL> that didn't make me go out and <VOCNOISE> um want to do that yknow <SIL> so <SIL> if anything it made me want not want to do it yknow because <SIL> my brother was in was in vietnam <SIL> he was in the army <SIL> and uh when i got my notice he's like three years older than me yknow and he's <SIL> so i mean it don't <SIL> they'll draft you they'll put you on the front line <SIL> i said well i'm going to <SIL> enlist in the airforce anyway <SIL> so
