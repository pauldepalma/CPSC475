<SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it makes it <SIL> yknow fun so you can <SIL> actually see what <SIL> yknow your <SIL> studying these teams <SIL> does yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you can go a whole season <SIL> yknow seventeen eighteen and o <SIL> and <SIL> nobody's <SIL> pretty much coming close to your standard and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when you win all that money it's just like yeah when you lose all that money it's like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's it <SIL> <LAUGH-I'm> going home <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> but <SIL> i've known people that gamble <SIL> yknow compulsively <SIL> i mean it's like a <CUTOFF-g=gambler> <SIL> gamblers anonymous <SIL> level <SIL> i couldn't really get into that <SIL> number one i'm not the richest person in the world and number two <SIL> just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> little money here is one thing but <SIL> when you're <CUTOFF-j=just> <SIL> out there spending your <SIL> car insurance money on it or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> rent money then <SIL> you got a real problem there <SIL> i've seen guys do that to <SIL> go down to scioto downs and bet the <SIL> bet the farm on <SIL> one horse and <SIL> wouldn't even do anything for them <SIL> <IVER>
