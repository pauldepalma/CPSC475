<SIL> and i said <SIL> yknow i don't know why you <SIL> are insecure <SIL> i said <SIL> everything you do you do well <SIL> i said <SIL> i <SIL> i try things and just bomb at them and i said <SIL> you just zip through them and i said <SIL> you'd <SIL> maybe some day when you're <SIL> older you'll look back and go <SIL> oh i see what dad was talking about but she just can't see that <IVER>
um <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> if <SIL> if she passed a hundred people <SIL> and ninety nine of them said <SIL> oh that's really pretty hair <SIL> oh those are nice earrings oh that's a nice shirt those are nice pants <SIL> and one guy goes <SIL> what's with that uh lipstick <SIL> she will remember that what's with that lipstick <SIL> for about a month <SIL> and i'm like <SIL> gosh <SIL> yknow <SIL> yknow <UNKNOWN> and that's sad <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
because i told her things like i said yknow what you really need to do is like in the morning when you're all done dressed you need to look the mirror and go <SIL> i look pretty good today <SIL> or <SIL> when you've done something like say uh she's in a play right now <SIL> and when you come home at night <VOCNOISE> you need to look in the mirror and go <SIL> i did pretty good at the play today <SIL> other people <SIL> did well but <SIL> i think i did the best i've done so far yknow <SIL> and <CUTOFF-i=it> uh <SIL> and it's not to make yourself an egomaniac <SIL> it's just to <SIL> yknow that's like those little subtle hints <IVER>
yeah that and i think <SIL> i i'm a firm believer that uh <SIL> little subtleties like that to yourself <SIL> are much better than look in the mirror and going <SIL> look at them hips <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you go this one you go <SIL> i'm getting a gut <SIL> and yknow it's like that's so negative to <CUTOFF-yoursel=yourself> would you <SIL> tell your <SIL> mom that <SIL> yknow <IVER>
yeah hey everybody has it <SIL> right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i mean uh i <CUTOFF-ha=had> <SIL> i had parents that <SIL> everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i couldn't do this couldn't do that and <SIL> and so what i try to do is when anything comes up <SIL> i always think of how my parents would handle it <SIL> and i do a hundred and eighty degrees <SIL> so yknow because the yknow they just <SIL> i don't know how i got <SIL> i sort of feel i'm mentally okay now but i don't know how i got here because <SIL> i've been the other way it hurt me yknow and it's well yknow <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
okay <IVER>
