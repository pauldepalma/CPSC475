<LAUGH> <IVER>
ours does that too <VOCNOISE> they're great <IVER>
sounds a lot like our dog <IVER>
yeah my sister <VOCNOISE> and her husband just moved back they went out to nebraska for a year <IVER>
<LAUGH> and then yeah i got the opportunity um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=a> <VOCNOISE> a company that my sister had worked for wanted her to come back <IVER>
and so they offered to move them back <IVER>
and um <SIL> it kind of worked out because her husband was losing his job any how <VOCNOISE> just kind of one of those okay let's do it <IVER>
and so <SIL> um my parents retired here <VOCNOISE> let's see <VOCNOISE> they've been here <VOCNOISE> i don't know four or five years maybe <IVER>
and my sister was here <VOCNOISE> like i said and then moved out just gotten <VOCNOISE> came back a couple months ago <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> my grandfather just passed away but he was here <VOCNOISE> in a nursing home for about a year <IVER>
um <IVER>
indirectly <VOCNOISE> yes <IVER>
um the <CUTOFF-r=reason?> <SIL> my sister was here only <IVER>
when i got here <VOCNOISE> but i was in <CUTOFF-d=?> one of those yknow youth <VOCNOISE> stupid uh psychopathic relationships shall we say <VOCNOISE> and i kind of needed to disappear <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> uh we never told him where <CUTOFF-sh=she> she had just moved <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> so i just came down here then <IVER>
so <SIL> was one of those <IVER>
things <VOCNOISE> get away from it all yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah so um i came down here <VOCNOISE> because he knew where my parents lived and plus columbus was a lot more opportunity <IVER>
so indirectly it was a very bad reason that i came here <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> it worked out <IVER>
yknow so <IVER>
right <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> well i even had that <IVER>
i mean my <CUTOFF-f=family?> <VOCNOISE> oh my sister said if you didn't leave him i was gonna staple your hair to the <LAUGH-wall> <LAUGH-UNKNOWN> but um she was <CUTOFF-jo=joking> she wasn't kidding though <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-becau=because> yknow it's just one of <CUTOFF-tho=those> oh i can help him yknow i've learned i'm the caretaker <VOCNOISE> like i roll my eyes <LAUGH-because_it's_like> <VOCNOISE> you can't change people that much stupid <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-y=yknow?> <VOCNOISE> it's weird because it was terrible <VOCNOISE> but because he was real controlling and yknow you start to doubt yourself like <VOCNOISE> did i say that <VOCNOISE> right and like he wouldn't let me sleep so then you start to lose that <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean <CUTOFF-y=you> <CUTOFF-real-=really> you <CUTOFF-s=start> really do start to lose your mental <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> woo <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yknow at the time i was like i'm not gonna get anything out of this and it was misery and <VOCNOISE-ugh> <VOCNOISE> what not but <VOCNOISE> i've met people that have been in <VOCNOISE> much worse situations <VOCNOISE> and at least i can kind of relate to them <IVER>
so in a <CUTOFF-w=way> in one way it's kind of a blessing <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> it's very <CUTOFF-f=?fortunate?frustrating?> <VOCNOISE> i my sister <VOCNOISE> has an undergrad in psychology <VOCNOISE> and she worked at like um <VOCNOISE> one of those <VOCNOISE> what do you call them those secretive houses like for women and their battered children that <SIL> yknow you're not supposed to <UNKNOWN> location and what not <VOCNOISE> and she used to get so frustrated um <VOCNOISE> because they'd always go back <IVER>
and <SIL> i understand that mentality now because i went back but i'll tell you the reason i left <LAUGH-was> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-st=stupid> <LAUGH-it's_gonna> sound stupid but <VOCNOISE> he took my teddy bear <VOCNOISE> which i loved and <ERROR-I'ved had for <VOCNOISE> not since i was a child but at least five years at that time <VOCNOISE> and he just <VOCNOISE> he knew i loved it <IVER>
and just took it and ripped it <IVER>
and and <SIL> that split second i was like <SIL> okay he's gonna do this to me he's gonna do this to my kids <IVER>
ain't no way <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
wow <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
it is <IVER>
that's important <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> even though it's an inanimate object it all kind of came together <IVER>
right <IVER>
and i was glad i realized that i <VOCNOISE> nobody would ever mess with my children <VOCNOISE> not even <VOCNOISE> their father my husband or whatever <IVER>
and i realized that so it was like ok <VOCNOISE> i'm not gonna do it for me but <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna do it <VOCNOISE> for the future <VOCNOISE> and and that helped <IVER>
because like i said it all came together because i don't understand how people can let their kids be hurt <SIL> but <IVER>
i'm <VOCNOISE> i'm not built that way <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
um <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
sure <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah it's always kind of scary <VOCNOISE> i think you really need to get away from that <VOCNOISE> to get your self back <IVER>
or you're just gonna go back because you don't know any other way at the time <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <SIL> right <VOCNOISE> but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared <VOCNOISE> doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute yknow uh <LAUGH> <LAUGH-it's> so obvious hello <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but <LAUGH> oh yeah <IVER>
but just that freedom <VOCNOISE> yknow to do what you want to get some sleep to <SIL> eat to take care of yourself <VOCNOISE> to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what not <VOCNOISE> and then it's really clear but if you don't get that <VOCNOISE> and you're always thrust back into it <VOCNOISE> i don't think you can break free <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
that's true <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> no <VOCNOISE> which is i'm very grateful <VOCNOISE> he did like go past my <ERROR-haren=parents'> <VOCNOISE> parents' house and things like that <VOCNOISE> but then they moved here <VOCNOISE> and even though it's public records like who owns a house <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> luckily we haven't had that because <VOCNOISE> we purchased the house <VOCNOISE> my husband and i <NOISE> before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the deed has my maiden name on it <VOCNOISE> but uh no luckily <IVER>
and that's been <VOCNOISE> almost ten years <VOCNOISE> so hopefully <IVER>
hopefully <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> i'd just uh basically got out of a <CUTOFF-n=?> <VOCNOISE> a <VOCNOISE> a relationship <SIL> it was like a rebound type thing <VOCNOISE> um i was in a relationship for like three years <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> he was cheating on me <VOCNOISE> and so i felt really bad and why does he pick her and <VOCNOISE> and then i met this guy who seemed <VOCNOISE> wonderful <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> turned out <VOCNOISE> to be not so wonderful <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> i made a <LAUGH-lot_of_stupid> yknow you look back and you see things you were like this is real obvious <VOCNOISE> but at the time i think you <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> i was like <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> a i can either change them <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> if they love me <VOCNOISE> we can communicate <VOCNOISE> and change things and yknow <SIL> that type of thing <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> right <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-um> <LAUGH> first of all they're not really in love with you and <LAUGH-secondly_you're_wrong> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> so when i came here <VOCNOISE> um i didn't date <IVER>
for over five years <SIL> on purpose <VOCNOISE> i don't think it was supposed to be that long on purpose but i wouldn't let myself date for a couple years after just trying to figure out <IVER>
yknow okay <VOCNOISE> this is what i'm doing wrong let's not do it again <VOCNOISE-di_di_di_di_deh> <VOCNOISE> and then <LAUGH-nobody> asked me out for a few more <LAUGH-years_so> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> so that <LAUGH-worked_out> <VOCNOISE> uh so i really hadn't dated for a long time and then i started dating again <VOCNOISE> and what's weird is you almost go right back in <VOCNOISE> to the patterns because you're so scared you're gonna be alone you see yourself going <SIL> oh i can be with this person and you know in your head <LAUGH> this <LAUGH-person's> not for <EXT-you> <VOCNOISE> and then luckily <VOCNOISE> um indirectly i met my husband <IVER>
four <VOCNOISE> four years ago i don't know it's been awhile <VOCNOISE> four and a half years ago something like that <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> yeah it was like oh this makes sense and he might have these other wonderful <VOCNOISE> things that i'm used to but he's got all of <LAUGH-this> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> so i'll get that little slice and take the <LAUGH-rest> <VOCNOISE> so that worked out <IVER>
um <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that
