<VOCNOISE> you're in there flying and you're <UNKNOWN-pilots> turning and you're putting your flaps down and i go six nine eight juliet uh say your altitude and you're like um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-di=did> <SIL> did they call me <SIL> yknow because you have a lot of things going on <SIL> and i'm not i'd i'm i'm mister laid back in that area had a lot of people go i don't see how you can be so calm <SIL> but <SIL> yknow i always look at it though as yknow <SIL> i can scare you to death and you'll never come back to columbus <SIL> or any <SIL> airport that has a tower <SIL> or i can be nice to you and you can go out and spread the word that <SIL> yknow <SIL> there <UNKNOWN> <SIL> there's some people there that are pretty <IVER>
yknow so i figure <SIL> it's <SIL> it's much better to be nice to them because <SIL> there's also times when yknow everybody makes <SIL> errors <SIL> and yknow <SIL> maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh <SIL> yknow like there's an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way <SIL> and <SIL> i really meant for you turn left instead of right and <SIL> you may come back and go uh <CUTOFF-d=do> <SIL> do you do you mean left or right there and <SIL> i go <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yes that is <CUTOFF-r=right> <SIL> correct turn left yknow <UNKNOWN-he_uh> so yknow <SIL> everybody helps everybody out yknow i i feel kindness goes a long way <SIL> and the pilots the same way <CUTOFF-the=they're> <CUTOFF-mo=most?> <SIL> most often they're <SIL> yknow pretty decent <IVER>
