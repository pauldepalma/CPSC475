<IVER>
who am i going to vote for <IVER>
i have no idea it's kind of like picking the <VOCNOISE> the least of evils i mean <IVER>
i don't really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for elizabeth dole and then <VOCNOISE> she opened her mouth and things came out <LAUGH-and> <LAUGH> uh she had the best chance out of any uh <VOCNOISE> any woman that's ever run <VOCNOISE> for president and <VOCNOISE> she was <VOCNOISE> in a major party <VOCNOISE> which <VOCNOISE> hasn't happened before <VOCNOISE> and it would have been really funny to see what happened to bob dole over it <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yknow be the first <VOCNOISE> man after <HES-having> run for the office <IVER>
i don't know <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i kind of see al gore winning just because <VOCNOISE> he's the most like <IVER>
one of the <CUTOFF-mo=most> <VOCNOISE> he has the most experience <IVER>
in that <SIL> general <EXT-area> <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
i don't know i don't particularly like <SIL> anyone <IVER>
really <IVER>
although i haven't been paying a lot of attention to it <VOCNOISE> just because <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
yeah and because <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> back when i was in high school in my a p government class i was paying attention a lot yknow like <VOCNOISE> i read the <CUTOFF-g=?> <SIL> columbus dispatch everyday and i read u s news and world report <SIL> for my economics class and i was <VOCNOISE> totally caught up with everything <IVER>
and then i got here like <VOCNOISE> i don't <CUTOFF-wa=want> <VOCNOISE> i don't care <LAUGH> yknow <IVER>
yeah and <VOCNOISE> i i got to argue about stuff there here i'm just kind of sitting around <LAUGH> <IVER>
like trying to cram organic into my head and <IVER>
playing around with my linux <LAUGH-yknow> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah a lot more <VOCNOISE> just <IVER>
different <IVER>
things <VOCNOISE> yeah just <VOCNOISE> keeping my <VOCNOISE> g p a up enough and <IVER>
yeah i really really hate the fact <VOCNOISE> of a government telling me what to do <IVER>
i really hate that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and like affirmative action stuff totally burns me up the idea is wonderful but it's <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=so> <VOCNOISE> it's just <SIL> executed very poorly <VOCNOISE> i mean i saw like <VOCNOISE> during high school how easy it was for me to get in to places i mean the citadel was begging me to come <IVER>
yeah yeah they called me like a few times and just begging me to come i know how hard that is for <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> white males to get into <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> and i saw like one of my friends had to work so hard to get into m i t <IVER>
and then <VOCNOISE> there was another girl who <VOCNOISE> i really didn't think was <VOCNOISE> that smart she's kind of <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> inner blond <VOCNOISE> and she got in <LAUGH> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah it's just <IVER>
i see it working <SIL> <EXT-unfairly> <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> don't think that it <SIL> is just <VOCNOISE> executed properly <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i would almost rather have it <SIL> not at all <IVER>
than <VOCNOISE> have it executed <SIL> as it is now <IVER>
think in the case of a tie it should be used but <VOCNOISE> yknow like if there's <VOCNOISE> a black woman who is <VOCNOISE> very well qualified for a job <VOCNOISE> and a white male is <VOCNOISE> equally qualified for the job the black woman should get it <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> i'm like if test scores are identical and they have the exact same experience <VOCNOISE> yknow objective <SIL> ways <IVER>
they are identical <VOCNOISE> then the black woman should get the job <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> there is no <SIL> to me <VOCNOISE> the most qualified should <CUTOFF-per=person> person should get the job <VOCNOISE> end of story <VOCNOISE> and that's it <VOCNOISE> yknow it's <VOCNOISE> it's best for <VOCNOISE> society in general <IVER>
just employers need to be <VOCNOISE> employers just need to do that on their own <VOCNOISE> and it's tough to be able to trust <SIL> uh business like that but <VOCNOISE> it's a private business they need to be able to <IVER>
yknow they can do whatever they want <IVER>
um <IVER>
i do not like <LAUGH-bussing> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i just don't <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think it's <SIL> it's kind of like you get what you pay for <IVER>
anyway and <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i'm not saying in general but with the experiences that i've had <VOCNOISE> um certain families where they don't <SIL> uh socioeconomically just not as well off <IVER>
it doesn't matter how much money they're given for their education they've <CUTOFF-s=seen> <IVER>
they won't take <VOCNOISE> proper advantage of it <VOCNOISE> because <CUTOFF-the=they> <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> have their parents to look up to <VOCNOISE> who didn't take advantage of it <IVER>
yknow so if it's kind of the mentality if my parents did okay without it then i don't need it <IVER>
so the money's just kind of wasted <IVER>
oh yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
yes <IVER>
hum <IVER>
no i haven't <LAUGH> <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> no i haven't been following it really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it's not that the <VOCNOISE> property taxes are that much higher anyway it's that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> the homes are worth more because of the school system <IVER>
and the safety of the neighborhood and <VOCNOISE> yeah there there are a few things <VOCNOISE> really that go into it <IVER>
yeah it basically <VOCNOISE> feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes <SIL> <CUTOFF-e=exorbitantly> <VOCNOISE> exorbitantly high i mean they it is a little higher but yeah <SIL> it it's not ridiculously high <IVER>
yeah <SIL> it is <VOCNOISE> worth more <VOCNOISE> what i can't understand is some people live in upper arlington <VOCNOISE> and they send their kids to <LAUGH-private_school> <IVER>
i don't understand that <IVER>
yeah you spend the money to live there and then you go somewhere else <VOCNOISE> i really don't understand that <VOCNOISE> some people do it <IVER>
yeah it was pretty much upper middle class <IVER>
um <SIL> and like even the people the maybe their apartments didn't look as impressive but they were making money <IVER>
and like <VOCNOISE> uh one of my friends <SIL> who had the apartment <VOCNOISE> in arlington <IVER>
they had this little apartment <VOCNOISE> she's from <SIL> india <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
her house in india is like this mansion and they have servants there <VOCNOISE> i mean it's <VOCNOISE> really <SIL> impressive just <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> houses are just worth more so you can't get as much house here <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but yeah everybody is doing well <LAUGH>
