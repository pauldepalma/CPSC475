<SIL> my answer to your question is has this eroded i'm gonna answer with the word using the word respect <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh yes i feel that uh <SIL> this has eroded over time <VOCNOISE> uh there's not the respect for our <SIL> elders i don't <VOCNOISE> necessarily mean elders in terms of the uh chronological age but i'm talking in terms of generations <VOCNOISE> the uh there's less respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the great grandparents <VOCNOISE> uh i'm gonna give you a first hand example <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just had a <SIL> uh conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now twenty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> she will come over to my house grandpa's house <VOCNOISE> and she'll come in and she'll flop down in a chair <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it <VOCNOISE> uh i don't ever <SIL> tell her uh do <SIL> to do things <VOCNOISE> and i've pointed out to her that whenever we went to visit grandpa <VOCNOISE> or great grandfather <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> if the if we saw weeds out in the garden we went out and we hoed the garden if we if or the chicken house need to be cleaned uh <VOCNOISE> and they hadn't gotten to it that day we went out and cleaned the chicken house we would say <VOCNOISE> grandpa is it okay if we go out and clean your chicken house well course you knew very well it was gonna be okay <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> a matter of respect though you ask is it okay for us to do it <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> now with her <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i can have dishes out there in the sink uh that are left there for from breakfast maybe <SIL> lunch and <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> she she'll walk out there and will say <VOCNOISE> well grandpa how come your dishes aren't done and then she turns around walks away <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's right you uh huh <SIL> and and she may then go ahead and say <VOCNOISE> well now sometimes she'll ask and sometimes she doesn't but lets assume she did she'll ask <VOCNOISE> is it alright if i have some of this <VOCNOISE> she goes ahead and gets the dishes out so forth <VOCNOISE> she puts them right in there in that sink uh with those other dishes <VOCNOISE> makes no efforts to clean them <SIL> <HES-and> and <SIL> i <SIL> i <SIL> i've seen this in many many many incidents but i'm giving you this is very first hand i know this <VOCNOISE> and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society today <VOCNOISE> so yes in my opinion definitely it's eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> from <SIL> over the time that that <SIL> this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she just used the word penalty <SIL> <EXT-uh> <VOCNOISE> penalty has <ERROR-nlots of different definitions each individual has a mental picture what the word penalty means <VOCNOISE> based upon their own experiences <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all i wanna take just <SIL> and it say it <SIL> penalty in a very general sort of way <SIL> <VOCNOISE> whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left lets come back to about the middle <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm concerned that we are getting away from penalties <SIL> completely <VOCNOISE> and i feel it's absolutely essential that we have penalties we have <VOCNOISE> for everyone <SIL> for everyone really across the board uh we we're getting away from penalty we're getting away from penalty <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> uh so many people i just to give an example <VOCNOISE> talking about adults <VOCNOISE> i just read uh statistics the other day right here <ERROR-kah columbus where <VOCNOISE> uh it was an extremely high percent i can't quote the percentages <VOCNOISE> of people who uh ignore uh yellow lights and and of consequence they are ending up going through red lights <VOCNOISE> and there many many many accidents taking place <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i <SIL> and we <SIL> it used to be that you could place uh uh an a law enforcement officer the corner if it happened and he immediately he would uh <VOCNOISE> penalize you by giving your ticket and you face the <SIL> court as the case may be <VOCNOISE> well now we have passed so many little ordinances and laws and change the <VOCNOISE> enforcement policies and this kinds of things <VOCNOISE> well the poor police officer he can't even do that any longer he's got <VOCNOISE> if somebody uh runs through red light you almost have to hit somebody <VOCNOISE> and then be accused for going through the red light <SIL> he can't just arbitrarily be there because that's called <VOCNOISE> <EXT-oh> i think the word harassment plays a part <VOCNOISE> you are harassing that individual because you were standing there waiting for him <VOCNOISE> to commit this problem <VOCNOISE> when i <SIL> let's just get away from that example you can talk about whether you did you were carrying <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i don't want to get in to the guns and knives and stuff in the school that's enough for
