reader's digest <SIL> used to write their <SIL> digest on the eighth grade level and they now write it on the sixth grade level <SIL> newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level <VOCNOISE> for the general public it's just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> either <VOCNOISE> we're getting more and more l d kids that aren't learning to read <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> i read one article <VOCNOISE> that said that <VOCNOISE> because kids sit in front of a television set <SIL> from the time they're born until they're five <VOCNOISE> when they come to kindergarten they don't participate <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they want to sit back and be entertained <SIL> and they're expecting you to do all this stuff <SIL> and they're just gonna watch <IVER>
and they have to become an active learner and they have to be taught how to participate <IVER>
mm <IVER>
not so much when i was teaching it <SIL> because <SIL> i think <IVER>
when i was teaching it <SIL> that was kind of before all the moms went to work <IVER>
but since <SIL> all the moms have gone to work <SIL> and let the tv become the electronic babysitter <VOCNOISE> and the other thing that's happening <SIL> is kids do not know things now that you'd expect them to know like <VOCNOISE> because their moms aren't reading to them <SIL> like they don't know who winnie the pooh is <IVER>
or they don't know who eyor <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> or you <SIL> say something to a kid about um three blind mice <IVER>
or yknow the things that we learned when we were kids because <VOCNOISE> our mom <SIL> taught them or we learned them at church in a game or something <VOCNOISE> they all look at you like <SIL> christopher robin who's that <SIL> piglet <SIL> who's that <VOCNOISE> yknow these there's a whole generation of kids now <VOCNOISE> whose moms did not stay home and read to them and all that fairy tale stuff <VOCNOISE> and nursery rhyme stuff <VOCNOISE> they don't have a clue what you're talking about <IVER>
well <SIL> some of them are i guess <VOCNOISE> depending on <SIL> where they go but <VOCNOISE> i had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid <VOCNOISE> she only has maybe one or two kids in her whole class <VOCNOISE> that hasn't gone to preschool <SIL> or daycare <VOCNOISE> and she said it takes that kid <SIL> up till christmas <SIL> to catch up <SIL> with the <SIL> things the other kids come in already knowing <SIL> that's how far behind they are <VOCNOISE> used to be in kindergarten you were expected <VOCNOISE> to know your colors <SIL> and your name and your address <SIL> you didn't even have to write it it <SIL> you just had to know how to say it and your phone number <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> recognize the color words <SIL> and <SIL> know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills <VOCNOISE> and that was about <EXT-all> they expected you to <SIL> play cooperatively <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> that's about all they expect you to know now in kindergarten <VOCNOISE> they expected you to know all that <VOCNOISE> plus by the time you get to first grade you're supposed to have <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-b=?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-in=?> <SIL> oh and the numbers you used to <SIL> from one to thirty <SIL> it used to be if you could <CUTOFF-s=say> <SIL> uh <SIL> say them <SIL> in order <SIL> and recognize them <SIL> you didn't even have to know how to spell the word <VOCNOISE> or write them down <VOCNOISE> now <SIL> they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred <VOCNOISE> you're supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade <SIL>
