<SIL> <IVER>
uh <SIL> <NOISE> which <SIL> which the the as far as the the <CUTOFF-v=violence> <IVER>
violence <IVER>
there well there's the whole thing about the police chief <VOCNOISE> and then there's the whole thing about <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> about the <CUTOFF-laws=lawsuit> the federal lawsuit against columbus <IVER>

i'm not real up on this i know that um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <HES-he> he's done some things and <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i don't know <HES-I> i <CUTOFF-kn=know> <VOCNOISE> i don't know if it was drugs or <LAUGH-some-I-know> something ridiculous <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> that a lot of people and i think a lot of the <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-p=police> the police force and a lot of other officials are <VOCNOISE> are pretty much in agreement that he should resign <SIL> and he feels like <SIL> like he's just not going to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that we don't have any um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-w=we?> that the mayor can't <VOCNOISE> nobody can actually make him resign that that's something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as <VOCNOISE> yknow dorothy was teater was saying i'm gonna make him do this which is something that she doesn't have any power to do <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <HES-that> <HES-and> and about how <VOCNOISE> how they just continue to get raises and they're and they're not doing very much about it and <VOCNOISE> and less than fifty percent of the police force is actually in police cars and <VOCNOISE> and a lot people <HES-are> are doing desk jobs and those types of things and <HES-I> i guess a lot of people just aren't very happy with the job he's been doing <IVER>
and he just says yknow i <HES-don't> i <CUTOFF-do=don't> whether you like me or not i don't care <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna keep working <VOCNOISE> i don't know but i think it was something it was something real shady that he that he got into and i knew that <VOCNOISE> i don't know if it was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think it was <SIL> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> cocaine or <CUTOFF-some=something> i don't something <CUTOFF-wa=?> i don't <SIL> i don't know i mean something that was pretty shady <IVER>
yeah and i don't know if it's quite that <LAUGH-bad_but> <LAUGH> but it was certainly some things that he's been doing that aren't aren't approved of <SIL> and i'm not real up on that <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
isn't that <EXT-unbelievable> it's <IVER>
<EXT-amazing> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's almost worse though that it's not even a surprise <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>

yeah <IVER>
yknow i think a lot of times uh you yknow people aren't real rational as far as as who they <SIL> they go for <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i can certainly i can certainly see that <SIL> and that <CUTOFF-mih=me> <VOCNOISE> i think that yknow lot of <CUTOFF-th=the> a lot of people feel like too oh he's he's he's one us yknow he's like he's like we are kind of thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well michigan it's a ten year mandatory jail time sentence if you get caught with any cocaine at all <SIL> <IVER>
ten years no question about it that's it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're in jail for ten years eighteen years old <VOCNOISE> if you've got anything on ten years <NOISE> that's it <VOCNOISE> yknow and you look at some of these other people or like these sports people and <IVER>
<SIL> they get caught with that stuff or have <CUTOFF-ih=it> <SIL> and nothing happens and it just sets such a horrible example <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that here you've got you know some regular some <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> eighteen year old kid that does something really stupid <NOISE> and he's ten years in jail <VOCNOISE> and then you've got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can be elected well yknow and you just <SIL> it's just <SIL> it's so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's so wrong <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah well <IVER>
i don't even know what to <CUTOFF-sih=say> what a disgrace <LAUGH> <LAUGH-it's_just> embarrassing it really <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i did <SIL> i did <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean i think he's done some positive things that whole thing about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-eh=as> <CUTOFF-eh=as> as far as like your student loans and being able to get <LAUGH-into_s=into_school> <LAUGH> which has helped me yknow <VOCNOISE> and i <CUTOFF-thi=think> yknow all this that <CUTOFF-ae=as> as far as some of the issues go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um some of his foreign policy things i think have gone pretty decently but i mean i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't i don't know i mean it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> i don't know if if it really if you really <SIL> it <SIL> i feel like that they're that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with really <VOCNOISE> yknow and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they don't ever really put anything into action they just kind of skate along <SIL> yknow and i don't know if there's anything substantial i can say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that was a wonderful thing that you did that i feel very affected by it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> economy's fine <SIL> i mean so <CUTOFF-ah=it's> it's not that he's <VOCNOISE> not that he's doing a horrible job but i don't really know how much he's actually doing <VOCNOISE> yknow and i think that unfortunately spend a lot of your time trying to get out of <VOCNOISE> out of personal <SIL> issues that you've gotten yourself into and you can't really focus on anything that's that's positive that you wanna do for <VOCNOISE> for the country and i think <SIL> i think it's just too bad because i feel like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if i was president uh not that i wanna be president but <VOCNOISE> yknow you'd have three or four things that you'd think were very important you'd you'd <VOCNOISE> hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very competent that you'd feel like they'd actually be able to accomplish some things <VOCNOISE> and you'd really work to get some stuff done yknow and i don't know if it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if it's just because <VOCNOISE> yknow you have to <VOCNOISE> get agreement from all the other all the <SIL> everybody else in government before you can pass anything or or why <VOCNOISE> yknow why don't these things get taken care of i mean there's so many different issues that people wanna look at and <UNKNOWN> end up focusing on things like philip morris yknow <VOCNOISE> which is like the biggest thing in the whole world yknow and and there's so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that are important <VOCNOISE> i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know maybe i mean i don't <SIL> i don't i'm not real up on everything that's been done but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused and you and you would be able to say <VOCNOISE> yknow this is what there's these three things that i think are really important that i'm really gonna work to make sure that they get taking care of and <VOCNOISE> and i don't <SIL> i just think people kind of la-dee-da it and say well this is <VOCNOISE> it's like this yknow well we'll see what we can kind of do about it and then we'll <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i mean but i mean <VOCNOISE> we're not at a depression and <VOCNOISE> and the yknow the employment rate is fine and <VOCNOISE> healthcare is we've got some improvements there and like i said that <VOCNOISE> that student loan <LAUGH> <UNKNOWN-this_is_big_notes> yknow uh but i just <VOCNOISE> i mean so i wouldn't say he's done a a a horrible horrible job <VOCNOISE> but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we've wasted <VOCNOISE> but we could have spent that <CUTOFF-t=time> <VOCNOISE> money on something else yknow and you end up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> doing that <IVER>
yeah i usually don't <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> not quite there <LAUGH-yet> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not really <IVER>
