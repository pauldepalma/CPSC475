i'm not sure where my father would have been and my father was very liberal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh more so even than my mother <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because if it's not something that's part of your culture every day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow and and you've been told it's wrong and the catholic church said it was wrong as <ERROR-mots=most> <SIL> most religions do <VOCNOISE> i'm sure he would've <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow had some <SIL> concern but i think his his <VOCNOISE> intellect <SIL> would eventually have worked it out especially if you sat down and talked with him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he wouldn't have done yknow there wouldn't have been any gay bashing with him and <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there wouldn't have been <SIL> yknow what happened yknow to the the black man in jasper texas and the yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh the <UNKNOWN> the shepard boy in in <VOCNOISE> what was that oklahoma <SIL> uh yknow he wouldn't of <IVER>

hate crime is a is an <SIL> is an <SIL> interesting <SIL> term <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> all crimes all murders <SIL> are hate related i uh <SIL> i'm not sure <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it that's <SIL> uh it it's difficult i <SIL> we had civil rights laws many people were opposed to those but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was uh in an effort to correct <SIL> years <VOCNOISE> of <SIL> institutionalized racism <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=and> and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> a crime is a crime and yknow are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder <VOCNOISE> and there's already a a law on the books so i don't think we need to have <SIL> a hate crime <SIL> over and above that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-th=the> <CUTOFF-the=the> the people who murdered matthew shepard <SIL> should be tried and hopefully <VOCNOISE> convicted on the facts <VOCNOISE> and shouldn't have anything else added into it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh affirmative action programs and the busing did to people it's going to turn people against <SIL> uh <UNKNOWN> gays like it turned people against blacks for a while although <SIL> ultimately i think it did make a difference <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-ha=had> <SIL> i had a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in uh opening up restaurants in the south <SIL> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> marching and yknow going to yknow opening the schools in the south <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> i said to her one day are you disappointed that <SIL> things aren't better <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh yknow that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that wasn't my goal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my goal wasn't to change hearts and minds <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my goal was to change behavior <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and the behavior changed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> except now <SIL> i never thought i would live to see an <VOCNOISE> all white jury <SIL> convict white men <SIL> <VOCNOISE> of <ERROR-com=committing?> of killing a black man <SIL> we're in hearts and minds now <SIL> <IVER>
