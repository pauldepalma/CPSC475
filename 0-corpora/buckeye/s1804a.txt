<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> you just i think if you're open enough with your children these parents <VOCNOISE> and say you know we <CUTOFF-w-want> <SIL> we want to give you this option we really prefer you don't do this <VOCNOISE> but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected <IVER>
i mean i think that's the best way to <NOISE> address it <VOCNOISE> and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who <SIL> say well maybe i'm gay i don't know if i'm gay or what <SIL> well <SIL> hopefully <SIL> they'll know <SIL> their true identity <VOCNOISE> eventually <SIL> i mean yes some people <VOCNOISE> i mean i know men <VOCNOISE> several men who got married had children and then they <NOISE> decided they were gay <VOCNOISE> okay were they gay before but they did like women <IVER>
yknow and they did want the children <IVER>
and now <SIL> they live <VOCNOISE> in gay relationships <IVER>
but they said all along <SIL> they were gay <SIL> they just fought it <SIL> and they they didn't want the pressure from their families <IVER>
so <SIL> ah <SIL> you <NOISE> know <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i just think the more you're open about things <VOCNOISE> i just think that's the best why it <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> when you put things and don't talk about it that's when the problems start <IVER>
but i think kids in high school and stuff <SIL> some of them <NOISE> like <SIL> my brother in law is gay <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> when i met him i knew he was i <SIL> yknow <SIL> he was the type <SIL> some of them you can't tell well it doesn't matter what they look like <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but my husband said all through growing up <SIL> he liked men <SIL> he didn't like girls <VOCNOISE> he looked at <LAUGH-magazines you know all this stuff <VOCNOISE> and i thought that's so funny because growing up i just didn't know <SIL> know anybody that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um but <SIL> you know he was openly gay to his mother right from the beginning <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> she was from germany which made it a little tough because <SIL> yknow they didn't talk about <SIL> <UNKNOWN> those things <SIL> over there at all <NOISE> for a long time <SIL> but um <SIL> then she became very open with him and every but everybody knew <NOISE> <SIL> and that was in the eighties <NOISE> and <SIL> yknow <SIL> if some kids know it when they're young and growing up <SIL> yknow i don't know if it's best to not say it or to <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> be open but if they're open to their parents about it <VOCNOISE> then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better then <SIL> than if they wait <SIL> later on in their life <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> but some of sometimes i guess they change <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> most the men i knew <SIL> right off the bat <SIL> know i mean i mean it was it <VOCNOISE> and it was all through their life it wasn't as though they just said oh <SIL> i'm <CUTOFF-go-going> <SIL> i'm going be gay <IVER>
so <SIL> i just <SIL> with that terrible thing that happened <EXT-in> <SIL> montana <IVER>
with that boy <IVER>
and just just shows the ignorance in so many people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's at that really still bothers me that <SIL> there's there is <UNKNOWN> still so much of that going on <SIL> you know <IVER>
it was <IVER>
it is <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> it does <IVER>
yeah they have the gay pride parade and everything which is good they should be able to <IVER>
yes <IVER>
well <IVER>
yes <SIL> but you know what his parents are gonna <SIL> yknow really going to let people know that <IVER>
this just can't go on not that they're going to stop it totally <IVER>
but it made <SIL> a lot of people more aware <IVER>
that it's still really going on <SIL> yknow and his parents accepted him <IVER>
which <SIL> they have to <IVER>
you can't <SIL> you can't be <SIL> mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle <SIL> you just can't life's too short <SIL> you know <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> you can love them either way it doesn't make any difference <IVER>
<NOISE> they did <IVER>
i think so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
that is <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
no i don't either because i believe in the death penalty and i feel <SIL> taking a life like that leaving someone there just to die <IVER>
tied up to a fence <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know <SIL> i think they deserve to die <SIL> because <SIL> with the <SIL> prisons and the overcrowding that's a whole another subject <VOCNOISE> you know that <SIL> it's just amazing to me so many people are in there that <SIL> should be dead <SIL> i feel <SIL> because <SIL> we're just paying for them to <VOCNOISE> live in there <IVER>
but um <IVER>
yeah
