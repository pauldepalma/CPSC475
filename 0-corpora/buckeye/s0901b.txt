<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
absolutely <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yes <IVER>
i'd come back and it's <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
the simplest things <IVER>
<NOISE-um> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> actually <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> all over the papers and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i think <SIL> i mean i <EXT-I'd> i don't know what it was like really here i can imagine but <VOCNOISE> i mean there especially they really focused on <SIL> um <SIL> not columbine but <SIL> the one with the <SIL> the younger kids in arkansas <VOCNOISE> was it <SIL> the year before i was there for <SIL> both of those but <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> in the first one yknow they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear <CUTOFF-ho=holding> holding the gun <SIL> everywhere and <VOCNOISE> columbine <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and <VOCNOISE> yknow their facts were all over the place but that's another <VOCNOISE> kind of issue but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> what i think caused it i mean <SIL> i don't know i think that <SIL> like <SIL> more should've been made of the fact of <VOCNOISE> yknow this <SIL> like <SIL> terrible <VOCNOISE> sort of <SIL> resentment for the other students and <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> yknow i'm not in any way defending <SIL> the guys who did it but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> something <SIL> is wrong <SIL> not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> yknow that you would even <SIL> think of doing something like that <SIL> um <SIL> i don't know especially with <VOCNOISE> yknow everything that was said about the families and <SIL> yknow they didn't seem to <VOCNOISE> of course you never really know but they didn't seem to have grown up in this yknow terrible environment and <VOCNOISE> yknow have that sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> preconditioned or anything like that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yeah i think <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> a lot more effort <SIL> needs to be made <VOCNOISE> yknow to sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow placate those sort of situations and <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> who does it is sort of another question because <VOCNOISE> yknow the teachers already <SIL> are over worked and underpaid and <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> all those kind of things but <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
well i do think access is too easy but it's sort of <VOCNOISE> like anything else i think if laws were passed <SIL> the people who were <SIL> against it would be so <SIL> yknow <SIL> just beside themselves that it would <VOCNOISE> i don't know for how long but i think it would make <SIL> the situation <SIL> not with <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> the shootings and things like that but i think it would make <SIL> the <SIL> just the gun situation probably <CUTOFF-m=?> <SIL> much worse for a while because people would be <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> doing <SIL> illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean too many people have guns here <SIL> there's too much of a <VOCNOISE> in my opinion yknow there's too much of a gun culture <VOCNOISE> i mean over there <SIL> they've <SIL> pretty much <SIL> <VOCNOISE> outlawed guns except for hunting and things and the fact that <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> yknow of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that <SIL> obviously england's such a small country in comparison but <VOCNOISE> i mean that's just amazing to me <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> but it's true i mean the fact that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow the access is just <VOCNOISE> there's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> almost nothing barred and i mean <SIL> just the amount of people that i just hear sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow in conversation talking about oh yeah i <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> getting a gun for security and all this stuff it's like <SIL> yknow <SIL> <EXT-what> your chances of <VOCNOISE> number one needing it <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> number two <SIL> if you were in that just minute <VOCNOISE> percentage of <SIL> yknow <SIL> happen chance that you would need it the fact that <VOCNOISE> if you used it to shoot someone who wasn't yknow i <EXT-mean> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> everything is against you <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah exactly and it's just <VOCNOISE> it's just ridiculous but so many people don't seem to think that way and <VOCNOISE> i do think <VOCNOISE> yeah access <SIL> it would help if access <SIL> were restricted <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> at least if they were more <SIL> careful about it i mean it seems like even <VOCNOISE> the laws that there are in place now aren't necessarily followed and <SIL> yknow that kind of thing <IVER>
but the whole <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> especially with the first <VOCNOISE> few shootings yknow with the children's <VOCNOISE> i mean <IVER>
yknow they shouldn't know where the keys are if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that <VOCNOISE> a yknow how do you explain your way out of <SIL> your kids taking guns to school <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh were they were already in the garage did they not buy them themselves <IVER>
oh right <IVER>
oh right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <SIL> well it's sort of a problem as well the <SIL> yknow <SIL> does <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean uh it's seems <VOCNOISE> yknow from what i've read it <SIL> if you wanted to make a bomb it's fairly <CUTOFF-un=uncomplicated> <SIL> uncomplicated <SIL> yknow so <VOCNOISE> that's <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> at the age that they were <IVER>
i don't know <SIL> i <SIL> i wouldn't <SIL> personally like think that the parents should be held responsible <VOCNOISE> i mean they do have <VOCNOISE> yknow a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should've been more aware and <SIL> and especially because <VOCNOISE> i mean i believe that those <VOCNOISE> or at least one of the two had been in <VOCNOISE> counseling and <VOCNOISE> had to <SIL> yknow was doing it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> aggression management or something like that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yknow you would think <SIL> that <SIL> if they were going through something like that <VOCNOISE> you would just sort of <SIL> yknow maybe keep a closer eye on <SIL> what they were doing so i think <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> to that degree <SIL> yknow the parents should've <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> um <SIL> worse <VOCNOISE> sort of responsible <SIL> and also <VOCNOISE> with like their kids disposition i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> would you not notice some difference if something like that was going to happen i mean depending on <SIL> a <SIL> yknow how well they hid it or whatever but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think at that point though you're <SIL> you're so influenced by your peers <IVER>
that like <HES-uh> <SIL> the parental influence isn't as much as <SIL> yknow before then i think by the time that you are past adolescence <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
i know <IVER>
um <SIL> well like i said before i think <SIL> i don't know i think screening would be very difficult <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> especially <SIL> because at that age you're gonna have a lot of people who are <SIL> yknow people say things to say things and to get a reaction and <VOCNOISE> to tell their friends that <SIL> they said i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> they can play off <SIL> whatever and unless they were <VOCNOISE> yknow
