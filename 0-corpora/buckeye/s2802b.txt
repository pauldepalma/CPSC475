<CUTOFF-a=at> of at the same time everyday <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>

yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
uh it's <IVER>
it's open twenty four hours so <VOCNOISE> there's people that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you know it's like shifts overlap you know it's not like everybody leaves and there everybody comes in you know <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's like <SIL> um <SIL> <NOISE> like when we're there like the night shift people start to come in people that work from like eight to four <CUTOFF-eigh=eight> <SIL> eight p m to four a m and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that be really weird <VOCNOISE> i guess like nobody calls then <SIL> or something like <SIL> ten people call so she's like it's easy she's like i get paid to <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she said that it's like i don't know some people who work there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> i couldn't imagine working <VOCNOISE> complete nights you know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i like working two thirty to eleven i <CUTOFF-th=think> i'd rather work like <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> maybe like noon to eight <SIL> that would be better because then it's like <VOCNOISE> i mean i'm more <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=staying> <VOCNOISE> toned to staying up late anyway just because of like <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> how it is or whatever but like <VOCNOISE> i don't want to have to get up really early either like i could never imagine having a nine to five job like that be horrible <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> have to go to bed so early <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
it's okay <IVER>
i don't know like i think <CUTOFF-hi=high> <SIL> i think uh high school in general like they i people always talk about raising the standards you know <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for high <VOCNOISE> <EXT-for> high school things but <SIL> um <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's kind of like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's really hard <VOCNOISE> to to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like i've thought about before just what's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> wrong with like the education system in general <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think it's more of a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> more of like a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> college is a little bit different i guess but it's more of like this whole like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the teacher <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the teacher's talking <VOCNOISE> and it like it like the information goes from like <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-profe=professer> <SIL> like the teacher's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh mouth to the student's notes with like out <CUTOFF-go=going> <CUTOFF-w=with> without going through either of their brains you know it's like just from like real monotonous and like you know dates and blah blah blah about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know just like <CUTOFF-re=real> it's it's a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's real structured but it's real hard to think about <SIL> what then what i could what to do to change that <VOCNOISE> it's kind of like more <SIL> <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i mean i had really good like there was a couple really good teachers like my history <CUTOFF-tea=teachers> teachers and english teachers were really good <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> just because <VOCNOISE> you know <SIL> it was more <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like <SIL> they seemed like they wanted to be there as opposed to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm just doing this <CUTOFF-f=for> because i don't know why or whatever and it seems like too <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they they <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i hate it when people <SIL> it's obvious that if they didn't have the textbook they wouldn't know how to do it <VOCNOISE> you know like where if people didn't have their notes like they wouldn't be able to do it themselves you know <VOCNOISE> it's kind of like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and so i think <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it's> it's <CUTOFF-i=it's> <SIL> that when people have real enthusiasm and like <CUTOFF-y=you_know> or and <SIL> put a lot of effort into making it not the same everyday not just like a lecture and when then we do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> homework and turn it in like you know it's like <VOCNOISE> we do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> like in history class we do like role <VOCNOISE> role playing things and like <IVER>
plays <UNKNOWN> like we like just things that are different and like <VOCNOISE> my sociology and psychology teacher were real good he did he was the same guy who taught history <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he was real good too like it was really crazy obviously but like <VOCNOISE> it's just like <VOCNOISE> interesting <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> like the sociology of high school and like having a sociology class about a <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well well it's sort of like the sociology of like cliques you know <VOCNOISE> like how <SIL> how that develops like <VOCNOISE> how people <VOCNOISE> like some people seek <VOCNOISE> to <SIL> like <SIL> fit in <SIL> like <SIL> like <CUTOFF-that=that's> that's a real strong uh <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE>
