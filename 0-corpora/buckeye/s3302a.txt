watching it for a while <SIL> period and then since <SIL> deep space nine left i needed a little star trek fix every once and a while <VOCNOISE> so i started watching it i also don't have cable so ah it's on <VOCNOISE> u p n and fifty three doesn't come in terribly well so <VOCNOISE> um i mean sometimes it's like i don't want <SIL> kind of see what's going on but <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i liked it there's an episode i think it was in the third season where they were stuck on an island <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> island <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it's an island but a planet together i liked it <SIL> there i kinda like and i figure <VOCNOISE> they'll probably hook up but <VOCNOISE> i don't like how the show <VOCNOISE> <SIL> this show and this happened with deep space nine two and <SIL> even with <SIL> next generation for a little bit <VOCNOISE> how the show's become <SIL> soap opera like <VOCNOISE> um i mean the romantic aspects of the stories don't <EXT-really> appeal to me very much <VOCNOISE> um i'm more interested in the social things and yknow good old special effects <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i i think i like <SIL> that how it's kept with a sort of <SIL> i <SIL> tension and it's not <SIL> like <SIL> <UNKNOWN-yknow_I_mean> they're not <SIL> completely thrown together like <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> b'elanna and tom <SIL> which <SIL> i don't like that at all <IVER>
and it's just sort of like uh whenever it comes on i roll my eyes <VOCNOISE> that episode where they were stuck out in space and <VOCNOISE> <EXT-uh> just <VOCNOISE> if the tape can catch me rolling my eyes it's oh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
every week <SIL> i record them <LAUGH-too> <LAUGH> i <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> like x-files <LAUGH> <IVER>
i love that <IVER>
no i don't want them to get together i love the tension if they get together it's dead <VOCNOISE> whenever they get <SIL> uh <SIL> <UNKNOWN> any of there are like five or six examples where it looks like there gonna hook up i mean that one where there's like a <VOCNOISE> a <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> a the duplicate mulder <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> well that guy who can change form <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> in the movie they're about to kiss and <HES-I> i don't like it when they get that close <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i like the <VOCNOISE> how their <CUTOFF-per=professional> their relationship is still professional <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they interact with each other on that level first and they're very good friends <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they have that tension but they don't <SIL> succumb to it and <VOCNOISE> i really like it i just dislike it a little less <IVER>
or <CUTOFF-dis=dislike> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like it a little less or dislike it a little more when <SIL> when it <SIL> it looks like it's gonna come to <CUTOFF-clipping=someu-something> it looks like they're <SIL> it feels like they're trying to tease me <VOCNOISE> as an audience and uh uh i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's not something i feel peased by <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> particularly <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> which one are you <CUTOFF-talk=talking> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it felt innocent to me <SIL> and i liked that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um because all the other times where they started to kiss <SIL> it's always been like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> stereotypical romantic da da da da da <VOCNOISE> and that's like <SIL> wow two friends alone <SIL> it's new years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> perfect <SIL> yknow it wasn't it wasn't like they were gonna jump in the sack or anything like that <IVER>
it was just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i didn't object to that one at all <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i feel that the past season <SIL> the past two seasons really haven't been as strong as the earlier seasons <VOCNOISE> and so <SIL> in some ways i'm <SIL> yknow <HES-I> i <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> i'm not as upset about <SIL> the x-files <VOCNOISE> <SIL> completing it's run as i have been about other shows i mean it's also the simpsons <SIL> final season i've heard <IVER>
ah <SIL> i've heard it it hasn't been as <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I've> I've heard it from <SIL> less reputable sources <IVER>
so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> i love that show i've nearly every episode on tape but this past <SIL> this past season i've <SIL> i've been really disappointed <SIL> with the simpsons <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-wid=with> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
been highly <SIL> critical of of organized religion <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i mean i i think that the stories haven't been <SIL> ah i i mean i'm <SIL> some of my favorite <SIL> like lines from the simpsons is where there highly critical <UNKNOWN> one of my favorites is uh when bart <NOISE> <SIL> the one with where <SIL> bart thinks he loses his soul <SIL> which in some ways is kinda preachy <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> cause i mean <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> lisa takes <VOCNOISE> other positions like ya whether the soul is is real it doesn't matter da da da da da <VOCNOISE> but i love it one scene while they're <SIL> cleaning out the <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well <NOISE> bart and <HES-Milhouse> are being punished they're cleaning out the pipes <SIL> of the organs <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> the the pipes of the organ and uh <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> bart's like there's no such thing as a soul milhouse is like why would they lie to us what would they have to gain and then they <UNKNOWN> it cuts to uh <SIL> <ERROR-revel-reverend> <SIL> reverend lovejoy <VOCNOISE> emptying <VOCNOISE> the uh <SIL> uh <SIL> uh what are they uh the <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> tip jars the <UNKNOWN> the donation thing into a little change counting machine <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't hear cleaning <LAUGH> what would they have to gain <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah it's like what religion are you <LAUGH> oh that one it has all those <UNKNOWN> those great rules <NOISE-that_don't> work out in real life <VOCNOISE> christianity <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> you're happy and you know it clap your hands <IVER>
<LAUGH-Christians> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i <IVER>
i like that aspect i mean i don't know i don't pay attention to who the writers are <VOCNOISE> um so maybe the writing <SIL> has changed <IVER>
south pacific yeah <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
gambling <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i mean <SIL> i want to see how the season ends out it's just <SIL> a lot of the one's this season to me have just been disappointing the <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows <SIL> peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of <SIL> level off i mean the the simpsons had a stretch <VOCNOISE> from like their third year <SIL> through like their seventh where things were just <SIL> like <SIL> unbelievably funny and <SIL> then they had some writing changes i think and this <SIL> this season is just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <UNKNOWN> been <VOCNOISE> completely outrageous story lines <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> like <SIL> the jokes aren't as integrated into the story <IVER>
i mean there'll be <UNKNOWN> there seems to me there more one liners <VOCNOISE> so i'm a little disappointed i'm sad that the show's going off <SIL> the <CUTOFF-th=the> the show's gonna stop but i'm not as <VOCNOISE> sad because the product i'm getting now it <SIL> with the simpsons <VOCNOISE> having it being replaced by futurama which <SIL> ah i find to be <SIL> absolute genius <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> so it's not so bad it <SIL> x-files <VOCNOISE> i'm sad but not as sad based on the past couple seasons when deep space nine went off the <SIL> the air that one really bothered me <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> they even had a star trek replacement <IVER>
still on but uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
um <IVER>
kinda yknow we know but it's <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> what i've <SIL> liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then <SIL> you find out that it's not right <VOCNOISE> and that it's wrong i mean <SIL> there was the episode
