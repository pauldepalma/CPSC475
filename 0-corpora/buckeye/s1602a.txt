<SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> you're really smart <SIL> no you're not dumb <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but they sit in class and they see their friends just catch on to things <VOCNOISE> and that they can't do <VOCNOISE> and so then they say <VOCNOISE> well my parents are just saying that because they love me <SIL> i'm really stupid <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> and you have to actually ow them when they get to be this age that <VOCNOISE> look you have a hundred and seventeen i q <IVER>
so that m means you're a good problem solver you're a good logical <VOCNOISE> thinker <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you're good in science you're good at math <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> so there's a few things you're not good at <SIL> doesn't mean you're stupid <SIL> yknow <SIL> i'd much rather be stranded on an island with six <SIL> <IVER>
l d kids than <IVER>
<IVER>
with six normal kids <VOCNOISE> because l d kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there <VOCNOISE> and the normal kids would sit and cry <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
oh yes they are <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> generally <SIL> they have some area <VOCNOISE> i don't think i've ever met the kid <SIL> yet the <NOISE-special> kid <SIL> who <SIL> has no <SIL> area <SIL> that he doesn't excel in like <SIL> once i had a <VOCNOISE> sixth grade girl who <SIL> still didn't know her time tables in sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice <VOCNOISE> and in every single school production she was the lead singer <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i had a girl once that won all kind of medals in gymnastics at the state level <VOCNOISE> it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back i've had kids who they <VOCNOISE> got every badge you can get in boy scouts and <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean there's usually something that they're <VOCNOISE> really <SIL> it might not be related to school <VOCNOISE> but there's usually something that they're really really good at in some other area <VOCNOISE> like there's <VOCNOISE> swimming or <VOCNOISE> or scouting or whatever so <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> but generally speaking they will attack a problem <VOCNOISE> a totally different way than the norm <VOCNOISE> and they will come up with <SIL> much more creative solutions <SIL> than the normal <VOCNOISE> person with a hundred <VOCNOISE> or ninety five i q <SIL> now i've seen them long <NOISE-enough> to know that <VOCNOISE> and worked with them long enough to know that <VOCNOISE> well like i have one boy who can't spell them he still spells it t h i m <VOCNOISE> and he took my computer apart the other day and <VOCNOISE> adjusted something in the mother board and put it back together now it works <IVER>
<SIL> now i mean <VOCNOISE> if you saw his writing you'd think a cave man wrote it <VOCNOISE> it looks like <SIL> hieroglyphics or something <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i want something done with my printers or my computers i just go hey jared <SIL> i'm having trouble with this printer <VOCNOISE> takes it all apart <SIL> fixes it i mean <VOCNOISE> he's <LAUGH-really> really <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
well <SIL> that's the other thing they're a lot of times they're good in the arts <VOCNOISE> they're either <SIL> an artist i've a boy right now that's an eighth grader that's painting <VOCNOISE> a huge canvas for me <SIL> for my living room <VOCNOISE> because i haven't been able to find a picture so i brought in the picture <VOCNOISE> and he's <VOCNOISE> enlarging it and painting it for me <VOCNOISE> in his free time and <SIL> it's gonna go in my living room <SIL> and i mean it's <VOCNOISE> it's <CUTOFF-me=mean> i mean he's really quite the artist <VOCNOISE> in <VOCNOISE> music <VOCNOISE> arts <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> literature acting i've had kids that've been like <VOCNOISE> really <SIL> top notch actors in the school plays <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it's> <SIL> it's just <SIL> not necessarily <SIL> a school kind of thing that they're gonna be good at <SIL> but i try to explain to the parents that <SIL> just because your child learns differently <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is <SIL> no reason to think they won't be successful in life <VOCNOISE> mark spitz <SIL> won an olympic gold medal <VOCNOISE> he has a learning disability <SIL> cher bono can't remember a phone number without transposing two of the numbers <VOCNOISE> and she says that herself <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> einstein didn't learn to read until he was twelve <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> winston churchill <VOCNOISE> he stuttered until he was like seven or eight <VOCNOISE> uh walt disney was told by a manager at woolworth's that he would never have a creative idea in his life <IVER>
and fired him <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> beethoven <SIL> i think it <SIL> was beethoven that didn't talk <SIL> till he was like seven <VOCNOISE> they thought he was retarded <VOCNOISE> but you see these people just <SIL> they're brain's wired differently than ours is and <VOCNOISE> you just <SIL> you can't ever expect them <SIL> to approach any <SIL> problem like you would <VOCNOISE> because they won't <SIL> it just doesn't seem logical to them <VOCNOISE> they're usually real good at puzzles <SIL> they're usually real good at <SIL> yknow <SIL> things that <VOCNOISE> manipulatives <SIL> things that don't take words <SIL> things that you just hafta solve <SIL> by just manipulating things around <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
some of them are pretty good at that some of them aren't too <SIL> <LAUGH> some of them like when you have them copy uh like <VOCNOISE> up <SIL> from this box down to this box these little shapes <SIL> in a certain amount of time <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if their visual perception is messed up <SIL> they screw that all up <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> yknow the form goes this way they draw it this way <SIL> their brain flips it around on them <VOCNOISE> that's why they have trouble with n's and u's <VOCNOISE> and b's and d's <SIL> and they're still reversing <NOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> you <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ma=my?> normal kids that goes away about age eight <VOCNOISE> my kids they're still doing it <SIL> yknow they're still <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ma=make> or they might make an eight from the bottom up <SIL> instead of from the top down or a six from the bottom up <VOCNOISE> i even had a kid once that made ones from the bottom up <VOCNOISE> you could tell by watching them write that their brain didn't work like yours did <IVER>
well that <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-y=you?> <IVER>
well usually normal kids <IVER>
that's <VOCNOISE> that's yeah it's <SIL> developmental <VOCNOISE> because by the <SIL> did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school <VOCNOISE> it's <ERROR-becuth=because_that's> <ERROR-sat's=because_that's> when <VOCNOISE> some <SIL> expert <SIL> thought <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> one hemisphere or the other <VOCNOISE> was <SIL> dominant <SIL> but now they found out that the full dominance doesn't take over till about age eight <IVER>
you have a preference at five or six <VOCNOISE> but by the time you turn eight <VOCNOISE> one of your hemispheres is pretty much decided it's gonna be the one that runs the show <VOCNOISE> well then <VOCNOISE> that's when <SIL> those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture <SIL> so <SIL> hm <IVER>
oh <IVER>
no <SIL> i thought my son <IVER>
the one that's eighteen now <SIL> i thought he was gonna be left handed up <NOISE-until> <NOISE-he> <NOISE-was> like four <VOCNOISE> because his dad's left handed my sister's left handed <SIL> i have one left handed parent <VOCNOISE> well all of sudden one day he picked up the thing with the right hand and he's been <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-wri=writing?> with his right hand ever since <VOCNOISE> so you really can't tell <SIL> because they <SIL> they're pretty much <SIL> either or until they're about five <IVER>
and you don't have to worry if she writes her name backwards like a mirror image <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> because that'll all go away about second grade <IVER>
oh good <IVER>
i always hate it when people name their kids <VOCNOISE> jamilia kenisha <SIL> and i'm like <IVER>
oh boy <VOCNOISE> is this <SIL> kindergarten teacher gonna have fun with this <IVER>
little girl <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> i always think you should name a kid <SIL> i have opinions about everything see <VOCNOISE> i think you should name a kid <VOCNOISE> something that will fit him at eighty three <SIL> and eight <SIL> and in between <SIL> like we named our son robert <VOCNOISE> so when he was little he was robbie <SIL> now he's eighteen he's rob <VOCNOISE> when he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do he can be robert <SIL> paul <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> in kindergarten all he had to learn to write was <SIL> r o b <SIL> or r o b b y <SIL> so that it <SIL> yknow <SIL> i have a hard time picturing an eighty three year old woman as a tammy <SIL> <IVER>
for example so you should name <SIL> her tamara <IVER>
and call her tammy when she's little <IVER>
and then she can be called tam <IVER>
yknow when she's in her middle years and tamara when she's <SIL> yknow <SIL> but <SIL> yknow i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing <SIL> it's the one thing in life we get to do <VOCNOISE> where there's no restrictions <SIL> no laws <SIL> nobody gives you any limitations or parameters <VOCNOISE> they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
over that <SIL> right <SIL> and <IVER>
i uh i say you should <SIL> look <VOCNOISE> what we did is we look in the newspaper <VOCNOISE> and we found the top ten boys and the top ten girls names that have been the most popular for the last fifty years <IVER>
and we pick out of those <SIL> because <SIL> otherwise <SIL> your kid's gonna hate you <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> emma's sort of a timeless name <SIL> in that it's <SIL> it's <SIL> yknow <SIL> been around for a long time <VOCNOISE> yet <SIL> people don't associate it with <VOCNOISE> old women because <VOCNOISE> there are still emma's today <IVER>
i mean <IVER>
right <IVER>
and i mean it's <VOCNOISE> it's a <CUTOFF-w=word> <SIL> easy to spell <SIL> it's easy to say <SIL> and yknow <CUTOFF-i=it's> you can shorten it to em <SIL> or <IVER>
<IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> some names are just like <VOCNOISE> we had a friend once that <SIL> she got pregnant <SIL> like after her two boys were almost grown up <VOCNOISE> and they didn't ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy <VOCNOISE> so she named the little girl after her mother and her mother's name was harriet <IVER>
and i'm like <VOCNOISE> how can you go gitchy gitchy goo harriet <IVER>
doesn't seem right <LAUGH> <IVER>
harry yeah like oh my god what did we do like my grandmother's name was olive <VOCNOISE> when i was born my dad said why she looks just like your mother to my mom <VOCNOISE> and i've turned out to do everything that she did <VOCNOISE> i've turned out to teach <SIL> she was a teacher <VOCNOISE> i've turned out to be <VOCNOISE> yknow real good in the kitchen and baking and <VOCNOISE> i do like <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> crafts like she did knitting and crocheting and i do that <VOCNOISE> but i'm sure glad they didn't name me olive <IVER>
oh yeah herb <IVER>
the herbs <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> the herbs <SIL>
