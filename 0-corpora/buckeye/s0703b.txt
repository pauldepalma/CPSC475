<VOCNOISE> listen to music <IVER>
read the paper <VOCNOISE> and have the tv on if there's something i think i might wanna <CUTOFF-m=might> <VOCNOISE> i might be interested in so i just <SIL> do all those things and <VOCNOISE> do my machine <IVER>
uh just at home <VOCNOISE> i just have a tape that i use it's kathy smith <VOCNOISE> one of her <VOCNOISE> things that i really like <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
where do you do the aerobics <IVER>
yeah <IVER>

i think that step would be really fun i've never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me <IVER>
really <IVER>
wow <CUTOFF-yi-you> <VOCNOISE> yeah i know <IVER>
well i <VOCNOISE> believe me i know <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
my <CUTOFF-frie=friend> <IVER>
yeah because my friend has some place where she even teaches yoga and has she's real involved in it <VOCNOISE> that she goes to um <VOCNOISE> the one that i told you who's the realtor <VOCNOISE> but i should find out <LAUGH-where> that <LAUGH-studio_is> if i find out i'll let you know <VOCNOISE> because i know she <VOCNOISE> she goes to some place called crapala in pennsylvania from time to time and <VOCNOISE> who knows <VOCNOISE> i just <VOCNOISE> i don't really do it for the meditation or anything <IVER>
i just do it for the stretching it's almost like when i'm laying there and <CUTOFF-sh=she?> and kathy's saying <VOCNOISE> yknow take <SIL> even though i sound speedy <IVER>
i'm really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem yknow and so for me that's like <VOCNOISE> okay come on <VOCNOISE> i don't really want i don't want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff <VOCNOISE> i just wanna get going and do the rest of this <LAUGH-stuff> so <IVER>
the part of it no <VOCNOISE> its takes about fifty minutes but to do all the stretching <IVER>
because see <VOCNOISE> well i've had five babies yknow i really have to work when you talked about that <VOCNOISE> the older you get <VOCNOISE> i have to work <EXT-really> really hard to <VOCNOISE> stay in halfway decent shape <IVER>
so <IVER>
but i love it <IVER>
<CUTOFF-a=I> yeah i think it does <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> i like to exercise <VOCNOISE> i think it's fun i would just do it four hours a day if i could do that <VOCNOISE> although i haven't for the last <VOCNOISE> six weeks i haven't done anything because it's just i've had these other things that are <CUTOFF-r=really?> <VOCNOISE> that are really pressing <VOCNOISE> you know how that is you get you have some things you just have to get done <VOCNOISE> and then when i get this stuff cleared out <SIL> there'll be a break <SIL> and then i'll be able to go back to it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh wow <IVER>
that must be <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
now who does he work for <IVER>
oh <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> well i was because i was gonna say when you were talking about traveling <VOCNOISE> you'll be able to get him to have <CUTOFF-s <VOCNOISE> a job where he can do lots of traveling <VOCNOISE> i know um like my husband goes to europe and <VOCNOISE> goes yknow he goes to california every month <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow he goes as <VOCNOISE> little as possible <VOCNOISE> but the point is <VOCNOISE> if i <CUTOFF-w=wanted> <VOCNOISE> if we wanted to be traveling <VOCNOISE> he could be going a lot more <VOCNOISE> a lot longer now he just goes for <VOCNOISE> yknow a couple days <VOCNOISE> at a time just to get back here because i don't like him to have to <CUTOFF-ge=go?> well and he doesn't wanna be away from us <VOCNOISE> but <ERROR-y=your> <VOCNOISE> your husband you'll be in a position you can he can latch on to something where you'll be able to have lots of opportunities to travel <IVER>
you will <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
it is it's <IVER>
right <IVER>
well i know with myself when we had <VOCNOISE> pete always says that <VOCNOISE> it wasn't for me he would have gotten just too immersed in his job because he is really involved yknow he likes what he's doing <VOCNOISE> he has tremendous responsibility and <VOCNOISE> but he loves it but the thing is <VOCNOISE> when the <ERROR-kidth=kids> were little too yknow i was always having to pull him back and say <SIL> don't forget <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> they're gonna grow up fast if you if you don't spend this time <VOCNOISE> and now <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> like i said the youngest is thirteen and so he's been at this for all these years and <VOCNOISE> i don't have to do that anymore i mean <VOCNOISE> someplace along the way about ten years ago <VOCNOISE> he got so involved in their lives but when they're little <IVER>
it's a real different thing i mean you can understand why <VOCNOISE> it'd be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours <EXT-when> yknow you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on but <VOCNOISE> he used to always <VOCNOISE> he would come home from work <VOCNOISE> and then go back to work after they were in bed <SIL> so that i wouldn't have to deal with it the whole time <IVER>
and work later then <VOCNOISE> which was fine by me <VOCNOISE> or he'd call and he'd say <VOCNOISE> is it okay if i work a little late <CUTOFF-toni=tonight> would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that <IVER>
wouldn't even think about asking <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
sure <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> oh and i've <VOCNOISE> and i'm sure it will <VOCNOISE> especially when you already recognize that <VOCNOISE> yknow <ERROR-i=if> if if you already know in advance what kinds of things you're gonna be <SIL> uh helping along it's a lot easier than <SIL> trying to figure out what's going on here yknow <IVER>
uh huh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
right <IVER>
uh <IVER>
i <VOCNOISE> that's certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain <SIL> doesn't <LAUGH-work_in_ways_that_other> people's do <VOCNOISE> so i think <CUTOFF-so=some> <VOCNOISE> i think a lot of it too has to <VOCNOISE> to <VOCNOISE> do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean i've gotten so much better over the years i was very <VOCNOISE> i've always been real <SIL> <CUTOFF-l=lot> <VOCNOISE> lot more temperamental <VOCNOISE> we always joke yknow that <SIL> that predictable and <VOCNOISE> some of those things are not <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> even tempered are not things you would use to describe me <UNKNOWN> but <VOCNOISE> but <CUTOFF-n=not> not in a negative <VOCNOISE> negative way yknow i just think that as i've gotten older too i've been able to see things and not be so <VOCNOISE> get so concerned about things that <VOCNOISE> that really weren't that important anymore <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> i don't know just lucky <LAUGH> <IVER>
i know i was thinking that before when you were telling me stuff <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i <CUTOFF-do=don't> i yknow i think too i apologize to my oldest daughter <SIL> <LAUGH-almost> every day about the poor thing all i put her through when <VOCNOISE> we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i wasn't a child <VOCNOISE> but it's like <VOCNOISE> you don't have realistic expectations <VOCNOISE> of what <VOCNOISE> what children are capable of or what they can do because if they're really verbal <VOCNOISE> and my kids always have been really verbal because i've talked to them from the moment they were born <VOCNOISE> even <CUTOFF-whe=when> yknow when they couldn't talk to me that was irrelevant <VOCNOISE> i was talking to them the whole <CUTOFF-t=time> obviously <VOCNOISE> see i don't shut up <VOCNOISE> so i would talk to them the whole time and <VOCNOISE> so they would always be really verbal and so it seemed like they <CUTOFF-we=were> <CUTOFF-w=were> <VOCNOISE> had a much better understanding and could do things better than <VOCNOISE> they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster <VOCNOISE> and i said well yknow you make sure you give it food and water <VOCNOISE> and when it died it <CUTOFF-n=never?> <VOCNOISE> i was so surprised that she hadn't given him been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you don't <VOCNOISE> yeah they don't get that stuff together <VOCNOISE> or when she was eleven we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could <CUTOFF-t=to?> wait to buy something else well within <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> three or four months it was gone yknow and so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress on the floor in her room because <VOCNOISE> but i mean now that was bizarre <VOCNOISE> now <VOCNOISE> with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things or i <HES-would> <VOCNOISE> i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it <VOCNOISE> and secondly <VOCNOISE>
