<SIL> if you are determined as having too much stress by your doctor then the government will pay for a vacation for you <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
just they're that into <SIL> being sure you're relaxed enough <IVER>
<SIL> you know and nobody does the sixty hour work weeks like <SIL> some people apparently are accustomed to around here <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
i mean forty is like the limit <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah they do um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think it's something like sixty percent <IVER>
um we pay like forty fifty here <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well there's like <VOCNOISE> and you take federal and state and all that and add it up <IVER>
yeah they have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well okay they do have sales tax but it's added in to the price before <VOCNOISE> so you're not just <NOISE> sitting there trying to figure out what it is <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i wish they could <IVER>
yeah oh my uh <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm in this uh venturing crew which is <SIL> through boy scouts our leader has this <SIL> like <SIL> society totally planned out <IVER>
<LAUGH> he's got this thing like <VOCNOISE> thirty percent sales tax and no other tax at all and then <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> it all <SIL> gets <SIL> i don't know it all works itself out he he <SIL> every other day you start him on taxes and he'll just start fuming <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's uh business man <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> he really doesn't like it <VOCNOISE> like how things work <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it's called <HES-uh> uh venturing crew <VOCNOISE> it's kind of this off <HES-uh> off shoot of uh boy scouts <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it's for ages teen twenty one <SIL> uh co ed <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we focus on computers but <SIL> we <SIL> do camping and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he teaches us a lot of uh business uh business ethic and <IVER>
um professionalism as well <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> it's <SIL> like um <SIL> i don't know they used to have something called exploring posts <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that were directly related and then <SIL> um <SIL> venturing kind of took over for that like <SIL> in still in boy scouts and then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> exploring went off on it's own <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> as a result they took religion out of the program and they put <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they <EXT-allow> like homosexuality with the leaders and all that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know we call it like hippy boy scouts <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> um one of my best friends from <SIL> high school and my boyfriend are both in it <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they bugged me about it for ever to come and like i don't know about computers <LAUGH> so they <SIL> took me finally like december something <IVER>
and and i have an office within the posi- within the um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> program now and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah and it's just incredible how much i've learned <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think i learn more in that program than i do in all my classes put together <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yes and no <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean we have high schoolers in there <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> there's no requirements for what school you go to um <VOCNOISE> but we get <SIL> our <VOCNOISE> <SIL> internet service partially through ohio state <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <UNKNOWN> the vast majority of college students go here <SIL> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um what happened was we know see one of the people on our committee <VOCNOISE> <SIL> teaches in the math department here <IVER>
so he the math server has tons of extra room on it <VOCNOISE> so he just kind of snuck in our account <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i it is legal but i'm not <SIL> sure how related to university is <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't think we take up huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through oar net as well <SIL> which is <SIL> i think it's just up lane avenue <SIL> uh they give us the domain name and all that <SIL> <IVER>
yeah i <VOCNOISE> oh gosh seems like incredible i mean <SIL> i i used to not understand what the right click on windows was <LAUGH> that was like when i moved in and now all of a sudden like <SIL> i can't i installed my own d v d player in my computer <VOCNOISE> like tore the case off and did it <IVER>
it's actually not that difficult but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-it's> it's um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and <SIL> there it is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> um <SIL> let's see what was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <SIL> decoder card was a little more difficult i had somebody else do it for me <SIL> <IVER>
um i have a decoder card it <SIL> what it does is it make <SIL> it decodes the d v d <VOCNOISE> right away rather than sending it through the processor <SIL> so it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a lot faster it doesn't depend on my processor time like it <SIL> the movie doesn't skip or anything <SIL> it it just goes straight through <SIL> um <SIL> let's see <VOCNOISE> no no nothing like that uh <SIL> twice a month we have <SIL> our technical modules which are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we hook up the tiny little yknow green screen computers and the little old keyboards from like nineteen eighty five <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow sit there and tinker on those <SIL> <IVER>
and then once month we'll have a leadership module which is uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the business ethics <SIL> part <SIL> and yknow set goal setting and that type thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then once month we'll just have like donatos pizza <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and like <SIL> just just discuss basic <SIL> and just general things <VOCNOISE> we'll like events coming up we had <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we planted the flowers at murfield <VOCNOISE> <SIL> last weekend and the weekend before <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was it two <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know i can't wait for it to start just because i want to watch it on tv and like i planted those <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> you see the the nick <SIL> jack nicholas golf statue <SIL> in front of the clubhouse i planted the flowers around that <LAUGH> <SIL> no i i don't want to watch it for the golf at all i just want turn it on and see it occasionally <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um yeah actually <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> they had just posted something on the <CUTOFF-in=internet> on the email today they have these old machines that used to be <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh they're called three b twos and <SIL> a t and t used to run on them <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and they're just really old and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean just ridiculously like seventies <LAUGH> just ridiculous and he's giving them out <SIL> but the only thing is if you take one you have to finish <SIL> like you have to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> install a disk drive <SIL> <IVER>
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm thinking i may get into that <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> for like summer project or something <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i like this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's more interesting it's a lot more practical <SIL> yknow it's little more problem solving less running around and shooting things <VOCNOISE> yknow um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's like problem solving type <SIL> yknow little puzzles it's <SIL> not as much <SIL> sit in front of a tv and be entertained it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you create your own <VOCNOISE> entertainment <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <SIL> no <IVER>
um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's an ego trip that's all <UNKNOWN> basically <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's like look i can do this <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
