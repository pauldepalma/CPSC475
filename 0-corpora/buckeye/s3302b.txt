<SIL> uh the two parter <SIL> uh last season where it was <SIL> the advertises full disclosure <IVER>
and <IVER>
what <SIL> and the first episode the first half was <SIL> excellent had the cigarette smoking man just <SIL> it was from his perspective <VOCNOISE> he was talking that then the second half got like <IVER>
oh no <VOCNOISE> and it turns out it was the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the uh the faceless aliens set a trap for the <VOCNOISE> for the guys and <SIL> i didn't like the way it was resolved but i like the fact that it wasn't <SIL> resolved the way that they set it up <VOCNOISE> so i think that <SIL> i mean <CUTOFF-w=we> <SIL> we supposedly know about samantha <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-f=?> <SIL> she's out there somewhere <VOCNOISE> yknow we don't <SIL> have <SIL> again we don't have clear evidence <VOCNOISE> where she is and there were couple times where they <SIL> where we thought we knew where samantha was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> and when there were all those clones of her <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i think that was in the second season or so <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think if <CUTOFF-th=the> <VOCNOISE> if they were gonna end it they were gonna have to have like three episodes in a row that just were tieing up all these loose ends that they keep having <VOCNOISE> i suspect they probably won't do that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they'll <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> leave things open ended for <SIL> future tv movies or maybe another <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> feature length movie <SIL> uh <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and they're also talking about <SIL> cause <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> the actors <SIL> the the reason they're <SIL> ending it <SIL> is because the actors don't wanna do it there was talk i don't know if there still pursuing this <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> they'd have new <SIL> characters <SIL> take over the roles and <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the character development is the most important part i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so i think that'll be a failure but that also <SIL> sorta <SIL> tells me that they're gonna leave things kinda open <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it> <IVER>
they they could've taken <SIL> <EXT-other> <VOCNOISE> i mean well they killed all these people off but <CUTOFF-i=?> they <SIL> could've <SIL> you'll put them into the background <SIL> you have them do a couple of shows a season <VOCNOISE> and then had <VOCNOISE> yknow i don't know the adventures of <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> oh <CUTOFF-S=Spender> <SIL> agent spender and <CUTOFF-w=what> <SIL> the hell what's <VOCNOISE> what's her name <VOCNOISE> but then they they killed off <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all those like <SIL> supporting <SIL> former x-files associated people <IVER>
so they they couldn't go in that direction they'd have to just bring in new people which uh <VOCNOISE> i think it <SIL> probably wouldn't be a good idea <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
i <VOCNOISE> i used to kinda worry about the effect that tv had on me <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i when i was little i used to watch a lot of tv <SIL> i'd come home from school and plop myself in front of the tv <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and watch <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i like yknow four cartoons back to back or so everyday after school or i <SIL> that kind of thing and then saturday mornings it would be uh a block of <SIL> yknow from six in the morning until afternoon <VOCNOISE> or something these days i don't watch <SIL> nearly that much tv <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i don't buy these <SIL> arguments that people make that say that <SIL> like <SIL> children <SIL> are <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> like violence in tv is affecting children i mean <UNKNOWN> i i've seen some <CUTOFF-e=evidence> evidence of <SIL> of <SIL> exercises where in schools the <SIL> kids will watch uh <SIL> like a a violent cartoon like <SIL> i don't know like <SIL> roadrunner or something <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> be a little <SIL> rougher <VOCNOISE> but i <CUTOFF-d=don't> <SIL> i don't <EXT-think> <SIL> that it <SIL> it goes into like values i don't associate like <VOCNOISE> rising crime <SIL> or something with <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> like crime on tv or something i <VOCNOISE> i mean it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if there is a correlation <SIL> i mean i <VOCNOISE> i'm more of the <SIL> yknow like <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> parents have a greater influence on the <SIL> children then tv ever could <VOCNOISE> i mean i <ERROR-laugh=?> watched a lot tv but <SIL> i feel that my parents taught me was right and wrong and <SIL> i watched a lot of <SIL> rather violent tv violent movies all that kinda thing and uh <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
<CUTOFF-y=yeah> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i have become visually desensitized to <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> the violence that i see in movies and on tv <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i still see a distinct difference between that <SIL> and <SIL> real violence <SIL> um <SIL> i mean <SIL> in studying history i'm exposed to a number of <SIL> like <SIL> rather <VOCNOISE> gruesome events in history <SIL> that still <EXT-are> <SIL> <EXT-very> <SIL> i still find disturbing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <UNKNOWN> also <VOCNOISE> hang out in low life bars and every once in a while there'll be a fight and it it still it <SIL> i mean it <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <HES-it> <SIL> it still is <VOCNOISE> disturbing to me i i'm <SIL> i have a distinct difference in my head between <SIL> reality and fiction <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> maybe kids <SIL> like aren't making that distinction but <HES-I> <SIL> <HES-I> i don't think so and i think if if <SIL> someone isn't making that distinction <SIL> it's <VOCNIOSE> i don't know that <SIL> that they're not <CUTOFF-r=?> <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-d=don't> i don't know i don't have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have it <SIL> i feel that i have a distinct <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-distinction> uh uh very clear distinction between what is <SIL> uh <SIL> fact and what is fiction what is <SIL> true and what is imaginary <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> for me i don't think that television has affected me <SIL> in that way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i mean one way that <CUTOFF-tele=television> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> television has affected me <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> i am full of media references when i speak yknow when i'm hanging out with friends someone <SIL> mentions a <SIL> a subject i'm like hey <SIL> simpsons made fun of that <SIL> yknow at some point <SIL> ah <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> that's the effect that it sees on me i don't think that's too big an effect people always used to <SIL> yknow like <SIL> quote <SIL> shakespeare or something i guess that's <SIL> ten times more <SIL> elevated so like oh <UNKNOWN> references that shakespeare line or something but <SIL> i mean it <UNKNOWN> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's a part of our culture and i'm a part of <SIL> it <IVER>
but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't see it as negatively effecting me i still get all the stuff done i need to get done <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> well i found that <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> i mean <CUTOFF-e=every> everyone <SIL> has <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-s=stereotypes> <SIL> people from outside the united states have stereotypes about the united states and when they actually get to know someone <VOCNOISE> <SIL> those stereotypes dissipate <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i actually had a conversation very similar to <SIL> this <VOCNOISE> the other night <SIL> with a <CUTOFF-G=German> <SIL> couple of germans that i met <SIL> at a coffee house <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i mean the <SIL> the stereotype that most <SIL> americans have of germans are those of bavarians <VOCNOISE> uh and not real bavarians but stereotypical bavarians uh <VOCNOISE> beer drinking bratwurst eating <VOCNOISE> sauerkraut eating <VOCNOISE> lederhosen wearing <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow <IVER>
blond haired blue eyed <SIL> overweight people <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> <LAUGH> <IVER>
