<SIL> but um <SIL> i was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i was interested in uh seeing <SIL> uh coleman be elected yes <SIL> because <SIL> uh <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she's a republican <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh i used to work with <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> not directly but indirectly so <SIL> i <SIL> certainly didn't want <EXCLUDE-name> to be elected <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she was the rudest woman <SIL> <IVER>
yeah i would she was like a <SIL> uh <SIL> community <SIL> liaison <SIL> uh with our corporation <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i was a supervisor <SIL> on my job and sometimes i would have very very <VOCNOISE> difficult <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> clients <VOCNOISE> that i need advice <SIL> from her on how to <SIL> yknow go about <SIL> working with them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> <CUTOFF-sh=she> i would call her and she would um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh just be really rude <SIL> not helpful <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum well you you had a <CUTOFF-ha=had> had a good reason be bothered <SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-so> uh coleman yknow he had a good uh record <IVER>
yknow on the council and that kind of thing so <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> he's democrat <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow like yknow i said well ok yknow <SIL> give him a shot anything but <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> because i thought yknow basically the city's been ran pretty well <SIL> basically <SIL> yknow as far as cities are <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> right <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the mall issue <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i felt that uh <SIL> yknow <SIL> polaris <SIL> mall would be good <SIL> for the city <SIL> uh even though i wanted <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-Northland> <SIL> northland mall <SIL> <VOCNOISE> to stay there that a seemed to be the big issue yknow with <SIL> northland mall <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i knew that uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they'd already made that promise <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and there's a lot of <SIL> businesses <SIL> that could move out of that area <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow and half those taxes come to columbus <SIL> even if a business is in westerville <SIL> half the <CUTOFF-tak=tax> <SIL> the employees tax are going to um <SIL> westerville and half are coming columbus <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-so> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i felt like yknow <SIL> the polaris mall <SIL> would <SIL> benefit <SIL> columbus <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all all the way around yknow <SIL> uh as far as uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow what was going on with that jacobs coming here and running all that advertising about northland mall and everything <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i can understand yknow the residents of northland <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> wanting their mall to remain but i didn't feel like yknow that had anything do with polaris being built <SIL> <IVER>
see i live close to <IVER>
<SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that would be the closest mall to me is northland <SIL> it's convenient for me <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then there's a lot <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow that they could do with that mall too <SIL> that <SIL> might make me even <CUTOFF-ga=gonna wanna go there more <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
if they <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh it has yknow your basic uh <SIL> lazarus <SIL> which i like to go to lazarus and sears <SIL> and j c penny's <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i wouldn't want to drive to polaris to go to those stores <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but if they made some outlets over there <SIL> yknow <SIL> that i'd <NOISE> be happy with that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh there's just a lot of smaller <SIL> stores yknow like victoria secrets and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> bookstores and toy stores and <SIL> athletic wear <VOCNOISE> stores <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> lot those i don't even go to <SIL> got some kiosks set up outside <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow with <VOCNOISE> little the little carts with different little things they sell <SIL> just like your basic kind of mall <IVER>
<SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't go to city center too much <SIL> although i like it being there if i want to go to it <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah because the traffic <SIL> but see where i live i could get on the bus if i <CUTOFF-w=wanted> <SIL> just wanted to go downtown <SIL> real bad <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> stops in front of my house <SIL> <IVER>

<SIL> and do like that <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> i don't get on it but i mean it's there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
<SIL> it's been good for my son <IVER>
uh being here at the <SIL> university <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <IVER>
