<SIL> belgium is it's own country <IVER>
i don't know where i'm going to fly into honestly i'm <NOISE-thinking> <NOISE-of> <ERROR-ih=of> doing a courier flight <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> mm-hmm <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
town with the chunnel <IVER>
take the ferry from <ERROR-southeastt=southeast> london <SIL> <IVER>
prague <SIL> <VOCNOISE> czech <SIL> republic <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> budapest <IVER>
that's the optimism yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> okay i have now dover <SIL> and ferry <SIL> what else do i need to remember <IVER>
<SIL> okay now i have <SIL> bruge <SIL> ferry to <SIL> i'm sorry <VOCNOISE> dover ferry to bruge belgium <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then train <IVER>
at that point i <ERROR-gi=get> to activate <SIL> my eurail pass <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i teach a class on thursday nights <NOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> how to play with computers <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-I> um <SIL> play games on tuesday nights <SIL> <IVER>
<EXT-games> <SIL> i don't know <EXT-we> we vary it from one week to the next <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE-either> <SIL> role playing games <IVER>
under whatever system <NOISE-is> popular that <SIL> day <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> <EXT-or> card games <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> not usually fifty two card deck cards but <SIL> other interesting types of cards <IVER>
or board games <SIL> or <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> anything that happens to appeal <SIL> <IVER>
is a <IVER>
group of five guys who know each other <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <EXT-mm> <SIL> no <SIL> some of them play at game stores <NOISE-but> i <SIL> done it once and said eh <SIL> it wasn't that good <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and continue merrily on with <SIL> my day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> there you go <IVER>
i had enough <SIL> friends who said to me <VOCNOISE> can you make money with computers <SIL> <NOISE-and> i said <SIL> yes you can make <ERROR-oney=money> with computers <SIL> and i said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what <SIL> could i <oney=money> with computers <SIL> <IVER>
then i finally just said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> okay <SIL> <LAUGH> training people to make <SIL> money with computers <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> <IVER>
none of these <NOISE-people> <VOCNOISE> would <SIL> well <SIL> no <SIL> some of these people would know what ebay is but probably only one or two out of like six <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what we're talking an extraordinarily low level understanding of what computers are how they work so <VOCNOISE> class one was demystifying the computer <SIL> we took it apart <VOCNOISE> we labeled everything inside i gave them all a piece i said put it back together <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we turned it on we saw if it <SIL> worked <SIL> we went back in figured out why it didn't work <SIL> took it apart again <VOCNOISE> this wasn't something can do hardware because hardware <VOCNOISE> <SIL> has <SIL> no money in it <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um it was so that they're not scared of the magic box <IVER>
and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scared of the magic box and could continue to operating systems <EXT-word> <EXT-um> <SIL> the goal of learning operating systems is real simple <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if you're playing with computer <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you screw something up <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the worst thing you can possibly do <SIL> is screw it up so badly that you have to start over <SIL> <IVER>
starting over means <SIL> putting a new operating system on it <IVER>
<SIL> <SIL> anything else <SIL> is a hardware failure and you have to go <SIL> fix it <SIL> somewhere else anyway <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> if you know how to put an operating system on your machine <SIL> you can start over <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you can start over there's no reason to be scared of anything that you do <SIL> problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they're going to break something <SIL> <IVER>
so once you convince people that there's nothing <ERROR-ne=to> be scared of here and there's nothing to be scared of there <VOCNOISE> i mean and then they start to play <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> and once you start playing you start learning <SIL> <IVER>
if you can't play <SIL> you won't learn you just sit there and follow my directions and that's dumb <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> most of them are still sadly just sitting there and following my directions but they're getting better <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <EXT-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> weekends i usually try and keep <SIL> free <SIL> so that i can <SIL> make stuff up <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> and uh <SIL> i don't <VOCNOISE-know> <SIL> because of the usually the the one night a week that isn't <SIL> horribly well scheduled <VOCNOISE> wednesday nights are preparing for travel <SIL> <IVER>
and you told me not to this that <SIL> <ERROR-s=so> <SIL> trying <ERROR-t=to> stick to that sorry <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> <IVER>
friday nights are date night <SIL> <IVER>
because i become unpopular if i have <SIL> like <SIL> <NOISE> any time away from my girlfriend <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> the more time i have away <ERROR-fram=from> <SIL> no <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> no <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh this is sherry <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <EXT-uh> i spend time away from sharon i become unpopular <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and if i continue to do that for a long <SIL> for long period time i become very unpopular <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> so to that end we have <VOCNOISE> a designated friday evening date night <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> sherry usually tries to get <SIL> all of saturday and all of sunday as date night as well <SIL> sort of like an extended date weekend thing <IVER>
this is a game we play every weekend <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <SIL> it's <EXT-a> <SIL> okay game <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> monday night <SIL> i usually <SIL> come up with something dumb that needs to occur <SIL> <IVER>

<SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> if i'd grown up with them maybe they'd have that thing going on that my sister has which is a bunch of <VOCNOISE> shared mutual experiences but as it stands they're just weird <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> so <IVER>
i'm drifting <NOISE> <IVER>
now you will hear me way too much <IVER>
<NOISE> <EXT-I> was interested in going out to <NOISE-california> and i been out there several times but <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> ooh <NOISE> <SIL> it <NOISE-supposed> <NOISE-to> <NOISE-be> <NOISE-tight> <UNKNOWN> uh why wasn't i not interested in moving out with my mother <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at the same time <SIL> no now it's on my chin <VOCNOISE> get off my chin <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at the same time <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> <NOISE> <UNKNOWN-that's> <SIL> my mother and my dad split up <SIL> i was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just about to start my second year at worthington high school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i'm about to start my sophomore year <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-and> <SIL> for the first time in <HES-something> like three years i'm at this school <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> for two years in a row <VOCNOISE> and so i was like <SIL> no <SIL> i i just finally made friends there's no way in <LAUGH-hell> <LAUGH-I'm> <LAUGH-leaving> <LAUGH-the> <LAUGH-friends> <LAUGH-I> <LAUGH-just> <LAUGH-finally> <LAUGH-succeeded> <LAUGH-in> <LAUGH-making> <VOCNOISE> um my father and i always <NOISE-understood> <NOISE-each> <NOISE-other> <NOISE> noise <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <ERROR-error=word> whining <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so my father and i <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna start getting phone calls here in a little bit i'll just postpone <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> my father and i always for the third time <NOISE> understood each other much better <SIL> then my mother and i did <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> we were able to communicate in a very similar fashions <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we didn't always agree in fact i am probably more diametrically opposed to him than anybody else i ever got to play with <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at least he understood what was going on from one moment to the next <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and so it was kind of a no brainer it was like all my friends and somebody who understands
