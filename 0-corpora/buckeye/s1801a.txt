<HES-um> i'm originally from columbus <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-and> <HES-um> <SIL> i'm an event coordinator for <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> which is <EXT-a> <VOCNOISE> excellent caterer <SIL> in german village <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm <SIL> forty three years old i've just been married uh <SIL> three years i have no children <SIL> uh <SIL> i've lived in columbus most of my life although i have i went to school in atlanta <VOCNOISE> and i also lived in orlando florida <SIL> i used to have a uh interior plantscape business <VOCNOISE> and that's why i moved to florida <VOCNOISE> for <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i'm really interested in <VOCNOISE> horticulture interior design <SIL> botany <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but when i did move back from columbus i was amazed with all the <VOCNOISE> just in a five year span how <SIL> much had grown and <SIL> i think it's a really <VOCNOISE> good city to live in i think it's really <VOCNOISE> progressed well and <SIL> i enjoy living here <IVER>
uh <CUTOFF-s=six> <SIL> six years ago <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
five years <IVER>
amazing how much the growth in delaware and different areas when <VOCNOISE> i was growing up here and how marysville and it was such a farm <SIL> town <VOCNOISE> um just <SIL> the growth of the <SIL> different cities and suburbs of <SIL> columbus is amazing and the <VOCNOISE> housing and <IVER>
shopping <SIL> you know <SIL> but it's just become a really good <VOCNOISE> metropolitan city i mean it's on it's way <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yep <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> now with easton i think it's really helped <VOCNOISE> with columbus and <VOCNOISE> yknow i think it's just gonna get better and better <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yes <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
columbus needs that as much people don't want other things to close i just feel we have to keep <SIL> we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i don't think that's <SIL> really fair to them <IVER>
hm <IVER>
oh yeah that's beautiful <SIL> yeah <IVER>
it's nice they have a real nice arts festival every spring <SIL> if you ever get a chance go down in march <IVER>

yes <VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
you know what <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> actually <VOCNOISE> i don't believe they have anything booked so far lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather <VOCNOISE> than having people come in to their homes and things <VOCNOISE> i've usually i've worked for <SIL> different hotels where i've always worked on new year's eve <VOCNOISE> and my husband this year is like yknow <SIL> but we don't even have any plans <NOISE-we> were gonna maybe do <VOCNOISE-something> with <VOCNOISE-some> friends and they're going to california so i'm not sure <VOCNOISE> even exactly what i'm gonna do but <SIL> <HES-um> <SIL> right now there's not an event scheduled <IVER>
which could change <NOISE> <IVER>
they are but the seems like they're going out <VOCNOISE> yeah instead of having <VOCNOISE> we don't do things in hotels and things because they have in house <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
yes private homes and um actually <SIL> where i worked there's not a facility <IVER>
for parties <VOCNOISE> so because it's actually a market <VOCNOISE> it's all done outside like tonight we're going to the uh galberth pavilion which is <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> next to the ohio theater <VOCNOISE> it's really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there <IVER>
