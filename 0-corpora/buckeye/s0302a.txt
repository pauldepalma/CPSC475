i appreciate your opinions <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but were you asking <SIL> did you have we seen a change in the politicians <VOCNOISE> and through our lifetime was that particularly your point <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> okay <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <UNKNOWN-i_don't=i_i_dn> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will <SIL> also be changing in the future <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> going all the way back uh finances uh <HES-were> were not a consideration in the in oh i'd say probably my first thirty maybe even forty years <VOCNOISE> there was some there was influence <VOCNOISE> but i think the influence was not financial <SIL> it was influence from <VOCNOISE> the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people <VOCNOISE> and sway them with his <VOCNOISE> and i want to use the word opinion but i know that's not right <SIL> it <SIL> he swayed them with <VOCNOISE> a position that he had developed <SIL> now that's not necessarily his opinion <VOCNOISE> so i'm trying to make a point there <LAUGH> <LAUGH-but> <VOCNOISE> he would sway them based upon <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> influences that he had <CUTOFF-h=had> <VOCNOISE> had <CUTOFF-other> <SIL> uh <SIL> uh various people within his community or <SIL> whether <VOCNOISE> whether you're talking about a township or a county state whatever <VOCNOISE> it may be <VOCNOISE> and yes <SIL> uh uh then <SIL> <CUTOFF-perhaps=per> <SIL> slowly <VOCNOISE> then i think the finances came into play <VOCNOISE> and finances have come to a <CUTOFF-h=horrible> <SIL> horrible <VOCNOISE> horrible situation as of today and i'll leave out this <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-thi=the> <VOCNOISE> the last two years it <UNKNOWN-has> because it's because <VOCNOISE> it's rather <CUTOFF-sh=specific?> <SIL> specific right now <VOCNOISE> but uh going back to two years or four years ago <SIL> finances were still a very very heavy consideration <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> not not just on the uh national level <SIL> but i'm seeing it even on local levels <VOCNOISE> i know within the immediate community there are people out there <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-t=tell hey come on we'll go to dinner we'll go do this and we'll do this and do this just uh just barely barely breaking <VOCNOISE> <EXT-uh> the barrier but not breaking the law <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> so yes <SIL> very definitely <SIL> progressively <SIL> has changed <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
which one of them <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
old blue eyes that's right <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> uh-huh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <SIL> <EXT-I> don't know that that's a cause uh a it <SIL> <EXT-they> they as a <EXT-group> uh <SIL> and this was kind of a happenstance it <CUTOFF-occ=occurred> <VOCNOISE> this occurred <VOCNOISE> as a result of a very major world war <VOCNOISE> uh so <SIL> in <CUTOFF-t=terms> <SIL> in terms of them causing it <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-thi=there+it> it was there was a happenstance and <VOCNOISE> and part of this mass communication we're talking about <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> began with them <VOCNOISE> and yes they are a major influence because we were talking about numbers and you're talking about uh <VOCNOISE> a <ERROR-grezha=greater> a greater <SIL> inter communication <VOCNOISE> i'd like to go back one step <SIL> where we're talking about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> when i made mention that three doors down you don't even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that <VOCNOISE> uh i think that's <EXT-profound> <VOCNOISE> as an <SIL> individual communication we are nearing zero <VOCNOISE> in terms of global mass communication to everybody <CUTOFF-wi=with> <VOCNOISE> inner personal communications that's the key in my opinion <VOCNOISE> personal versus inner personal communications <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-eh=and> <CUTOFF-and> and <SIL> it's zero over here and we're almost a hundred percent over here <VOCNOISE> but when we're in this inner personal or global or massive whichever term is the most appropriate <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> john doe who speak here <VOCNOISE> he hasn't the faintest idea who jane doe is over here <VOCNOISE> on the personal <VOCNOISE> it used to be <SIL> that yeah you knew who this person <ERROR-rize=right+was?> over here that's jane doe that lives in that third house <VOCNOISE> and she married henry jackson don't you remember old henry <VOCNOISE> well henry was the guy that lived way over there <VOCNOISE> on the other side of town <VOCNOISE> mass communications as it is today <SIL> they haven't the faintest idea of where jane came from or where henry jackson or where <VOCNOISE> old <CUTOFF-jh=jackson> <SIL> whoever <LAUGH-it_was_lived_over_there_i_said> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i think uh the <CUTOFF-th-think> i <CUTOFF-h=have?> i <EXT-think> you <CUTOFF-m=must?> need to distinguish between the personal inner personal <SIL> relationship <SIL> so maybe i digress too far there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> or who the next door neighbor is <SIL> <VOCNOISE>
