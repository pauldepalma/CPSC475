<IVER>
um hum <IVER>
i don't really work with them all i basically do is i know a lot of people and everything and they <CUTOFF-c=come> tend to come in there for help and you know and i just kinda help out with the uh <IVER>
some of the work that <NOISE-needs> be done <IVER>
talk to them or whatever you know <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i tell <NOISE-people> they can go there <VOCNOISE> it's the v v a vietnam veteran's association some people don't even know about it you know <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> a lot of them they don't want any better they won't want anything different that's all they want <IVER>
i think that basically that's in a nut shell they've reached a point in their life where <VOCNOISE> you know that they're cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death or <SIL> um <SIL> smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh <CUTOFF-p=?> crack or whatever and uh <VOCNOISE> then just living <SIL> in a hell i mean <IVER>
basically because you know <SIL> the open shelter i don't know whether you ever been around there but it <SIL> it isn't a pretty sight you know <IVER>
i'd say of uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think they the the v v a in generally sees on the average <SIL> five seven ten something like that a day <VOCNOISE> and not all of them homeless <IVER>
and not all of them are <SIL> are vietnam vets either you know <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> but you know they tend to say i'd say of those there's about three <VOCNOISE> three to four of them that are vietnam veterans <VOCNOISE> uh a day <SIL> and they tend to <SIL> come back i mean i <CUTOFF-s=started> <VOCNOISE> originally started going in there just drinking coffee you know to kill time and everything you know <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now i kinda know everybody you know and <VOCNOISE> somebody'll walk in and i'll say hey how's it going you know <VOCNOISE> and they'll talk <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-th=then> then there's <SIL> i there's another thing to <CUTOFF-a=about> <CUTOFF-a=about> <SIL> about <VOCNOISE> a lot of the uh <SIL> people back uh vietnam <CUTOFF-ever=everything> and everything that the <SIL> they'll tend to talk to maybe you or talk to somebody else <SIL> and uh a like an authoritative figure and not believe a damn word they say <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <SIL> um hum <SIL> well they go to the clinic sometimes and uh <VOCNOISE> clinic's basically a pill popping place you know here <SIL> take these you'll feel better you know <VOCNOISE> then they they really don't get any <VOCNOISE> <SIL> satisfaction for what ails them you know that side of a <VOCNOISE> you know you tell you you tell them you can't drink but yet you give them a pill that'll give them the same effect you know <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> whose <IVER>

well i know people that'll sleep outside and uh <VOCNOISE> not all of them are veterans and everything but they there again they don't want to be a part of the quote unquote <SIL> sheltered <SIL> system you know <SIL> uh <SIL> staying at an open shelter v o a or something like that <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> i think it's just <VOCNOISE> if they're vietnam vets i think it's <SIL> the authority thing you know well you lied to me once you lied to me <VOCNOISE> four hundred times since then you know you <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> probably going to lie to me again you know and uh <VOCNOISE> then a lot of them i don't think are capable <VOCNOISE> while in their present condition i know like <EXCLUDE-name> the friend of mine i'm talking about <VOCNOISE> there's no way in hell that he could hold down a job <IVER>
right now <VOCNOISE> but i knew him when he was eight ten months <SIL> sober <SIL> and he worked every day <IVER>
but just something happened why he got <SIL> him and his girlfriend broke up <IVER>
and that was like <VOCNOISE> around christmas time <VOCNOISE> and i ran into him like february or something like that <VOCNOISE> and ever since february its <SIL> he's been <SIL> sitting on a bench getting drunk everyday <IVER>
and i sit there and go you know <VOCNOISE> i tell people <UNKNOWN> the <VOCNOISE> v a clinic and everything and they got a homeless <SIL> thing uh over there i say you know <SIL> this guy friend i know you know he's a vietnam vet <VOCNOISE> you guys need to get out there and help him you know <VOCNOISE> i mean you're in more of a uh <VOCNOISE> situation than i am to be able to go out and and and sit there and <VOCNOISE> but he wants me to take him like mary haven or something like that <VOCNOISE> and he's been there before and all he does is stay till he sobers up and goes back out <IVER>
