<SIL> aren't really saying much new where if they have a more compact time they could be so i'd like to see them <VOCNOISE> see the time reduced <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the conventions used to be interesting because they debated the platforms and <VOCNOISE> that's all settled now <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> and it's just sort of a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow the celebration type stuff well that's not <SIL> interesting <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> they couldn't change and move the primaries <SIL> like to may <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well that's it's competition to be earliest and the <CUTOFF-st=stupid> <VOCNOISE> the federal government's trying to stay <SIL> stay out of the state's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> face and <VOCNOISE> so again that's another one of those things that <VOCNOISE> just live with it i mean there's enough of there's enough things to do and fight in were it life but that's not worth it <VOCNOISE> ya know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's <VOCNOISE> probably what i'll do ignore it <CUTOFF-ti=till <CUTOFF-un=untill till like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> august or july and then start paying attention <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> wait right <UNKNOWN> the amount of money that is spend is just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i could just can't imagine <VOCNOISE> uh ya know millions and millions have been spent already <SIL> hundreds millions and <VOCNOISE> it's just starting <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
my background <IVER>
<UNKNOWN-what_do_you> mean <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i grew up in columbus i was born here <VOCNOISE> uh went to went and here at <SIL> o s u at <CUTOFF-sch=school> <VOCNOISE> for school as an undergrad <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i went to columbus public schools <SIL> uh didn't <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um um <SIL> always over on the west side same area of town <VOCNOISE> always lived there <CUTOFF-s=since live there now <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> came up here to o s u <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> got my bachelors in uh <SIL> english lit <VOCNOISE> and then went to case <UNKNOWN> western reserve for a masters <VOCNOISE> then i decided i wanted to go somewhere else in the country <VOCNOISE> after i got my library degree <SIL> and the only job i could find was here in <LAUGH-Columbus> <IVER>
it was a <CUTOFF-ti=tight <VOCNOISE-it> was real tight job market for librarians then <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-hell_yeah> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well it's good now <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> well the web again has changed that there's <VOCNOISE> computers <VOCNOISE> have made a big difference <SIL> uh it's more exciting now <VOCNOISE> for people who in that area um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> who are interested in <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's more emphasis on <SIL> information not books and <VOCNOISE> things <CUTOFF-a=are> going to the library it's <VOCNOISE> getting the <CUTOFF-infor=information> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
making information available so it's <VOCNOISE> i think it's attracting a different group of people and it's <SIL> it's <SIL> more interesting <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but it was real <VOCNOISE> <SIL> tough job market then so i ended up at the state library downtown <SIL> <VOCNOISE> worked there for five years and decided i <CUTOFF-ha=had> <SIL> wasn't anything else there for me <VOCNOISE> uh and got a job at this company <EXCLUDE-name> which was still relatively new there were like <VOCNOISE> hundred hundred and fifty employees <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> was in seventy eight <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and then i've just <SIL> i have <VOCNOISE> stayed there and it's <VOCNOISE> grown a lot and the work changes it's an interesting place to work because <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well first the job is almost a different job every year <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because so many changes are happening we're trying to stay out in front of what <VOCNOISE> in front of what library innovations in front of web <SIL> and net <ERROR-innervations=innovations> and trying to incorporate it all so it's <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> ya know it's <SIL> kind of exciting because you're <CUTOFF-i=in> getting in on things that are really new and <VOCNOISE> trying to master it the project i'm working on now <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> it's trying to find a way <CUTOFF-s=so> <SIL> to automatic to <SIL> create data that describes <SIL> web resources <SIL> so that libraries can take this data and put it in their catalog and integrate it with the regular collection <VOCNOISE> and we're doing a lot of <VOCNOISE> with a <SIL> yeah it is it's pretty <SIL> it's pretty neat project a lot of new things <VOCNOISE> who at <SIL> uh java and the web <LAUGH> give us <VOCNOISE> opportunities do things that we've talked about before but <VOCNOISE> couldn't really do very well <VOCNOISE> so it's pretty neat <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> well we didn't even have computers <IVER>
at our desks we had terminals that connected to a system <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah it was <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and ya know you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and isn't very ya know it was very slow and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> key in a few characters and send it and wait and <UNKNOWN> much different now <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
very different <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> just been a lot of innovations and <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> mm-hmm <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> my first job over here at the o s u main library was key punching <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
for the system they have now key punching the old card data into that <SIL> that was my first <SIL> first library job <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> i started at the real bottom of it <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> and i don't <CUTOFF-rea=really> <IVER>
uh it's <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> you just sit at the computer and <VOCNOISE> key the data in or <VOCNOISE> well the system we're doing now is you can put in like <VOCNOISE> um the address the u r l for a web resource <VOCNOISE> it goes out and extracts data analyzes what's there <VOCNOISE> and comes up with <VOCNOISE> ya know subject terminology and call numbers and <SIL> presents it back to you and then you can edit and do whatever you want with it <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> ya know it's <VOCNOISE> it's doing some of that <VOCNOISE> some of that the automatic assigning and <SIL> subject headings and call numbers that's <VOCNOISE> that's a lot of <VOCNOISE-re-research> we're doing a lot of research on that it's <VOCNOISE> got a ways to go it's getting better <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it's i mean it's a lot better than it was even a year ago <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well we put all kinds of information out on our own website <VOCNOISE> which there's so much it's very hard to find what you want <SIL> ya know it's <VOCNOISE> that's a constant problem with information is <SIL> the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want <VOCNOISE> but if you can't get to it <VOCNOISE> if it's not out there you can't find it <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> it it's a problem for us and for libraries because there's just a barrage of what they're getting and it's not just from us it's from the literature <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> there's literally <CUTOFF-do=dozens> <SIL> ya know <VOCNOISE> hundreds of library publications <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and it's a problem that <VOCNOISE> librarians are facing all the time they can't keep up <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
there's too much information and too much change <VOCNOISE> uh librarians <VOCNOISE-se-seem> <SIL> and this is against probably of the image of librarians are they're very <VOCNOISE> very <SIL> eager to embrace change <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> internet came out and <SIL> ya know <SIL> and when it <SIL> and when it got out of the area that was being used by universities or whatever for research that's what it was at first <VOCNOISE> librarians were right there they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they could do with it <VOCNOISE> um when p c's <VOCNOISE> we didn't <SIL> you know it was revolutionary when we announced we were gonna use i b m p c's <VOCNOISE> for access to the system and we provide you software you can do some of the work that you used to doing but <SIL> with us <VOCNOISE> in your computer <VOCNOISE> and it's like it was incredible that <SIL> i mean <SIL> we had trouble with the demand it was <CUTOFF-f=fantastic> <SIL> ya know like triple what we expected <SIL> librarians were ready for it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah make their job earlier and faster <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> ya know and <CUTOFF-librarian=librarians libraries like <SIL> so many other places especially at universities or <VOCNOISE> they've seen budget problems and <VOCNOISE> the subscriptions for <CUTOFF-seriou=serious> <VOCNOISE> periodicals are just outrageous <IVER>
some of those <VOCNOISE> triple every year <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah they do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well that's what <VOCNOISE> that's what they've done <SIL> well they've done that here too they've done every university <IVER>
well <IVER>
right but the ones that are raising are the ones that are the standards in the fields <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> right <SIL> and but more and more those are also available <SIL> on the web but you have to subscribe to them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so it's still and institutional subscription <VOCNOISE> i mean that's a constant problem for the serials people everywhere i mean <VOCNOISE> just it's incredible what's happened with the costs <SIL> ya know <SIL> i mean i've seen <SIL> articles that say some of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year <IVER>
but if you do that to <SIL> ten things it's some but it's in <SIL> integral to the university's collection <VOCNOISE> that really hits your budget <VOCNOISE> ya know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then there's always the professor who wants a particular journal because they like it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that you really didn't need <VOCNOISE> because then you could get more bang for your bucks <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah we do a lot of inter library loan too <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's it <IVER>
oh okay that was easy <IVER>
yeah it was easy <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah it was yeah it was interesting <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i usually don't have trouble <CUTOFF-talki=talking>
