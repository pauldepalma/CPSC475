um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> right <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well unfortunately i don't think it's fair <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i think in the long run <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> it doesn't have to be a college education because <SIL> most of those people probably wouldn't want <SIL> a college education <SIL> um but like a trade or a skill or something <VOCNOISE> it'll give them a little bit of hope <SIL> if they do wanna choose to get a job instead of <VOCNOISE> robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did <VOCNOISE> they have that choice <SIL> it's it's <SIL> it's up in their head okay i can either go <VOCNOISE> become a welder <VOCNOISE> or i can <CUTOFF-t-??> <CUTOFF-t=??> have a gun <VOCNOISE> um i mean if they want a college education <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> yeah it's <VOCNOISE> it's not fair <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> for <UNKNOWN> for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer <VOCNOISE> having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens <VOCNOISE> than somebody robbing me someday because they didn't get an education <VOCNOISE> i mean now that's a <SIL> broad spectrum and i know it's not all that cut and <EXT-dried> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yeah it would upset me <SIL> but hopefully i'd step back from it a little bit and go <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> maybe it is for the best <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah i think it is <SIL> course we were fiddling with that so much <UNKNOWN> <LAUGH> <IVER>
