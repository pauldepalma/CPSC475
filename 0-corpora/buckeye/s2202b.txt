<VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> those kids are uh <VOCNOISE> they're lack something in their upbringing <VOCNOISE> and i don't know what it is <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> thank goodness none of my kids ever <NOISE> took that sort of attitude <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i'd like to <VOCNOISE> i'd like to think that my wife and i <SIL> set them a good example <VOCNOISE> my wife was a <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> very conscientious <VOCNOISE> hard working woman <VOCNOISE> she <VOCNOISE> established a <VOCNOISE> secretarial <VOCNOISE> business there at our <CUTOFF-ha=home> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> for several years <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> anything that went out of there was <VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> i mean <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> she did <VOCNOISE> well quite a lot of typing for students over here graduate students <IVER>
<SIL> and <VOCNOISE> so she i gave her most uh <VOCNOISE> credit for <IVER>
our kids' upbringing <VOCNOISE> her mother <VOCNOISE> was a <VOCNOISE> cousin of uh <VOCNOISE> james thurber <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> was a <VOCNOISE> a <CUTOFF-w=want a want to be writer i <CUTOFF-r=?> mean her mother was <VOCNOISE> she <VOCNOISE> she wrote a <VOCNOISE> well she wrote quite a number of poems and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> paid to have them published in a small booklet <VOCNOISE> and some of <SIL> some of them were <SIL> <VOCNOISE> real good and some of them <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> my wife <VOCNOISE> wrote some poetry too <VOCNOISE> she'd be down there typing <VOCNOISE> and she'd <VOCNOISE> she always had these uh <NOISE> spiral notebooks <VOCNOISE> and she'd <VOCNOISE> stop and <VOCNOISE> get an idea for a poem maybe from something she is working on or i don't know what but <VOCNOISE> but anyway uh <VOCNOISE> she <CUTOFF-di=did> she wrote <VOCNOISE> quite a few poems some of them <VOCNOISE> real good poetry i thought <VOCNOISE> most of them of <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> more or less a <VOCNOISE> religious nature <SIL> and <SIL> moral nature <VOCNOISE> in fact uh <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> uh the <SIL> desk that <VOCNOISE> she had we <VOCNOISE> we finished off part of our basement she had her office down there <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> her desk is still down there and <VOCNOISE> one of the typewriters that she used but it's <VOCNOISE> i don't know it's been disused too for too long i guess because i've tried type on it <VOCNOISE> it uh <SIL> doesn't shift like it should and so uh <VOCNOISE> but anyway <VOCNOISE> she hadn't <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> how many these spiral notebooks around <VOCNOISE> and she'd just write in them <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> since she passed away in nineteen seventy nine <VOCNOISE> i have run across <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> well i just <CUTOFF-fi=finally> finally decided well those notebooks are down there and <VOCNOISE> if i need one for something i'll just <VOCNOISE> go ahead and use it <VOCNOISE> and i've <SIL> run across a couple of her poems that i didn't <VOCNOISE> know anything about <IVER>
and then was <VOCNOISE> or uh <VOCNOISE> sort of <SIL> good <IVER>
uh huh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
huh <IVER>
i think so <VOCNOISE> although <VOCNOISE> she was <SIL> working at her <VOCNOISE> desk most of the time so that <VOCNOISE> she didn't give them as much attention as <IVER>
as uh <VOCNOISE> a lot of mothers do <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> she was there <VOCNOISE> and if they needed her <VOCNOISE> for anything or <VOCNOISE> needed her to say no to something <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> she was there <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> yeah i think that uh <VOCNOISE> that probably had something to do with it <VOCNOISE> and the fact that our kids knew <VOCNOISE> what <SIL> our moral beliefs were <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> my oldest son <VOCNOISE> uh completed <SIL> what they call the god and country award in the church <VOCNOISE> which is <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-acroia=requires> uh <VOCNOISE> requires about as much <VOCNOISE> work as uh <SIL> eagle award <SIL> in the scouts <SIL> it's a <VOCNOISE> a scout sponsored but church centered <VOCNOISE> uh award <VOCNOISE> and then my <CUTOFF-s=second?> second son <VOCNOISE> got a his eagle award in the scouts <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> kind of proud of that <VOCNOISE> because it <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well it's not something that a lot of kids do yknow <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
my oldest son <VOCNOISE> was in vietnam <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> in fact <VOCNOISE> he uh <VOCNOISE> let's see i <SIL> i <CUTOFF-spo=suppose> i don't remember but i suppose that they <VOCNOISE> had a draft <VOCNOISE> when he was about twenty one <IVER>
anyway he <VOCNOISE> he went in for <SIL> less than a year i think and then he was discharged <VOCNOISE> and then he was called back <SIL> in <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> sent to vietnam <VOCNOISE> and it was uh <VOCNOISE> sort of a traumatic experience for him <VOCNOISE> that i think he has pretty well come out of but <VOCNOISE> he was in a <SIL> rural area he never was <VOCNOISE> up where he was doing any shooting himself <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> he was on k p one day <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> he said they had a big <VOCNOISE> an area <VOCNOISE> out away from any of the other buildings where they burned trash and that sort of stuff <VOCNOISE> so <CUTOFF-h=he> he said the <VOCNOISE> mess sergeant says um <VOCNOISE> shoemaker take that <VOCNOISE> can of trash out and uh <VOCNOISE> and burn it and you <SIL> probably better use <VOCNOISE> take some gasoline to throw on the stuff <VOCNOISE> to get it to burn <VOCNOISE> so he did he went out there <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> threw some gasoline on it <VOCNOISE> not <VOCNOISE> knowing that one of the other <CUTOFF-k=K> <VOCNOISE> K P's had been there ahead of him <VOCNOISE> and thrown gasoline on it so there was <VOCNOISE> i don't know how much gasoline on it <VOCNOISE> when he threw a match on it <IVER>
it <VOCNOISE> burned his <VOCNOISE> his front anyway <VOCNOISE> he got his hands up in front of his face so it didn't <VOCNOISE> burn his face but it <VOCNOISE> burned his legs and his <SIL> stomach <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> so he was in a hospital in <VOCNOISE> japan for some time <VOCNOISE> and then <NOISE> came home <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> he never <SIL> would never say a lot about it <IVER>
but he just <VOCNOISE> didn't have a very high opinion of the army <IVER>
and then <VOCNOISE> a couple of years later <VOCNOISE> he was working on a job in <VOCNOISE> the columbus coated fabrics plant which is <VOCNOISE> plant that makes <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN-own> <VOCNOISE> coated fabrics <VOCNOISE> they make <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> the main thing is uh auto upholstery car upholstery <VOCNOISE> anyway <VOCNOISE> they had big <VOCNOISE> rolling machines that <SIL> rolled this stuff out <VOCNOISE> and there's fumes came off of it <VOCNOISE> so they had <VOCNOISE> a big hood and exhaust system <IVER>
above it <VOCNOISE> and periodically they would have to clean those out because uh <VOCNOISE> the fan would draw in addition to fumes they'd draw some lint off of this uh <VOCNOISE> so he was up on top on these rollers <VOCNOISE> cleaning out the hood <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> with supposedly <VOCNOISE> nonflammable <SIL> solvent <IVER>
but it wasn't because it caught <SIL> fire <VOCNOISE> and that time he was burned on the back <IVER>
<LAUGH> he'd been burned <LAUGH> front and back <VOCNOISE> he was in the hospital burn ward for <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> two or three weeks <VOCNOISE> and it <VOCNOISE> it was um <VOCNOISE> the year that <VOCNOISE> one of the years that <VOCNOISE> ohio state played in the rose bowl now <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's the nearest i can uh <VOCNOISE> identify the time <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-ti=time> during the time that he was there <VOCNOISE> a girl who he <CUTOFF-b=been> he'd been going with just <VOCNOISE> occasionally not real steady <VOCNOISE> was there to see him every day <IVER>
<LAUGH-and_so> <VOCNOISE> when <VOCNOISE> shortly after he <VOCNOISE> was healed enough to go back to work <SIL> why <VOCNOISE> they were married <IVER>
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and had the two daughters <IVER>
hum <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
that's too true <VOCNOISE> it's uh <IVER>
hum <IVER>
well
