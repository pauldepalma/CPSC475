now that was up to age eighteen to or there about to <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think that the <VOCNOISE> you said get back to the very beginning of the birth and up to kindergarten so forth <CUTOFF-we=well> <VOCNOISE> i that's that's the family <VOCNOISE> but uh i think that we in our educational program <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we really need to start teaching uh <VOCNOISE> what i call the older values uh but but but good values i <UNKNOWN-won't_given_you> whether they're old or new but good values <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system <VOCNOISE> uh starting in the elementary right on up to college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses <VOCNOISE> uh that that devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> assist in teaching <VOCNOISE> but i think that many of the courses <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> other courses ought to have <SIL> elements within them that are teaching value family values <VOCNOISE> um i could even so go so far as to saying chemistry or botany or psychology <VOCNOISE> uh any one of those <VOCNOISE> those are specialized subject <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> the i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those <VOCNOISE> talking about family value family value <VOCNOISE> uh and that will help them <VOCNOISE> permeate the entire society <SIL> and but it's got to start back here in the first and i think <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just uh <EXT-why> don't i just go back and copy cat something she said uh picking up that <CUTOFF-bay=baby> picking up that child and cuddling it um <SIL> and having <VOCNOISE> having that baby touch your skin and uh <VOCNOISE> and uh uh teaching <VOCNOISE> <SIL> how what love is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh you <CUTOFF-do> don't necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother little brother and the little sister <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all of those <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now you say <VOCNOISE> teach that well my god didn't they know that when they first came into this classroom <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no not today <VOCNOISE> not today <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i i dare say that uh the vast majority and i mean above fifty well above fifty percent when i say that i'm not being arbitrary <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> students in high school today <VOCNOISE> probably haven't had their mother or their father <VOCNOISE> <SIL> truly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> hold them and hug them <VOCNOISE> rather than just saying hi johnny <VOCNOISE> bye <IVER>
see you tomorrow <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> hold them <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> feel the warmth of the body <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> hear the conversation quietly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> rather than uh hearing okay <VOCNOISE> time to get out of here you know with a vigorous saying <VOCNOISE> but with pleasant sort of remark <VOCNOISE> these kind i can <CUTOFF-elaborah=elaborate> i could write a whole book on that <VOCNOISE> on this on answer your <ERROR-que-ers=questions> <VOCNOISE> uh but it's these kinds of things are very elementary really <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they're very elementary i guess to <VOCNOISE> our age group but maybe not so sure uh maybe the baby boomers that wouldn't be elementary at all <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> going back to your question about the baby boomers <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i still think they were <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't think they're causing them but then i think it was a happenstance uh with that group <VOCNOISE> with a massive group <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> variant <IVER>
