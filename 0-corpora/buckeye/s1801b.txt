you know <IVER>
you know i think a lot of it depends on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know if it's different parts of the country but cultures and everything <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because you know <SIL> it just seems in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah some parts of the midwest but maybe <SIL> kentucky and west virginia seems girls down there <SIL> a lot them get married so young they just that's just <SIL> what they want to do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they don't but they're not thinking <SIL> of any future <SIL> wanting to go to college or anything like that <SIL> have to cough is that okay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm sorry <NOISE> <LAUGH> i didn't want <VOCNOISE> be like <SIL> <IVER>

<NOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> no <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i have a beautiful niece i love her to death <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i knew at a young age <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and actually <SIL> wanted to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> make it a permanent decision but doctors at that time wouldn't do it i was like twenty five and i knew <NOISE> no they wouldn't even consider it they said you'll change your mind <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i knew i just never felt a mother instinct <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it's <SIL> funny <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh yesterday actually last night we went to visit a friend of ours had a baby <SIL> yesterday <SIL> two days ago <SIL> <SIL> <SIL> and when we left the room and she has a two year old child and now another <VOCNOISE> <SIL> little girl <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i said derek you know <NOISE> it's <SIL> it's nice to go in there and see that <SIL> but i just have no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> motherly instinct <SIL> towards <SIL> you know they're all like oh eric you should have one and yknow and he knows <LAUGH-knows_I'm_not_going_to_have_one> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i just knew at a young age i've always loved the animals <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and i <SIL> it just i know it sounds crazy but i'd rather have ten animals and take care of them and different kinds of animals <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> than children i don't know why <SIL> i knew at a very young age <SIL> that i <VOCNOISE> wasn't important to me it wouldn't be a part of my life <SIL> <IVER>
they wouldn't <SIL> no <SIL> i <NOISE> went to two different <SIL> doctors and they said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you possibly will change your mind and <SIL> yknow i was single <SIL> um maybe if i would have been married they might have <VOCNOISE> considered it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> but <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> said no way would they do it <SIL> and we're talking fifteen years ago <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
isn't that amazing <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well it probably would have been <SIL> yeah <SIL> but they felt that i would change <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <SIL> i've also been a vegetarian for twenty two years <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when i first decided to do that everyone said oh you'll <SIL> change wait until you get married you'll you know and i don't eat any animals at all <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it's <SIL> it was just a conscious <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> decision <IVER>
<SIL> i'm <SIL> i never liked meat my parents always made me eat it once i went away to college <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i said i'm i'm not going to eat anymore and they're like oh <SIL> well we'll see <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i've never eat <SIL> <NOISE> eaten <NOISE> anything since <IVER>
<SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i've always felt good about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> people always said <SIL> <VOCNOISE> oh you don't even crave yknow what like a wendy's hamburger and all this stuff <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and once you make a decision like that you don't crave things like that you don't even <SIL> think about it <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> and i yknow they said well what if uh <SIL> for health reason they said you'd have to eat meat there's no way someone could tell me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that i would have to eat meat <SIL> <SIL> yknow <IVER>
to make me healthier or whatever because i've always been really healthy <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
there is <IVER>
there didn't used to be and especially in restaurants and everything and now it's such an open market and they know that they have to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> accommodate <SIL> every um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> body's taste <SIL> yknow i mean before no i'd have to go in to a restaurant and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> salad and baked potato yknow i mean there was nothing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> really nothing unless i go to a buffet and then all the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> food's so cooked down i mean honestly <VOCNOISE> yknow it's like no nutritional value <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no i knew i wouldn't change my mind on that either i'm pretty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> strong willed about <NOISE> <LAUGH-things> <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> and you know what i cook meat for my husband <SIL> i really don't cook <SIL> red meat <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because he's on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups <SIL> a lot of good soups for him with meat <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it really doesn't bother me to cook it <SIL> yknow i'm not go sit home make a roast every night <IVER>
but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he's limited his meat a little bit more but with men it's a lot harder <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think <SIL> yknow when they're <VOCNOISE> used to you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> meat and potato kind of families <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but like thanksgiving it just doesn't mean that much to me <SIL> i <SIL> i the family thing does but yknow the turkey <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-and_all_that> <SIL> we i don't cook it very often my sister we used to go to my sister's <IVER>
house <SIL> because she enjoys cooking and <SIL> makes it a little bit easier i tend to overcook the meat <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
you know i haven't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> i haven't tried that <SIL> no <SIL> no i eat tofu a little bit but not really that much and i probably <CUTOFF-sit=should> <SIL> should i've <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> tended to more to soy products <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and there's so much nutritional value and especially for women <SIL> yknow i think it's <SIL> <IVER>
really <SIL> um-hum <SIL> i think it's really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all these women <SIL> i know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> and they should <SIL> and very rarely do doctors even ask you about allergies <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> more and more and people don't even realize and they get sick so often <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they need to ask about allergies <SIL> <VOCNOISE> or even just have a little minor test that they can take <SIL> when people when they can't figure out what's wrong with them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because a lot of times it is allergic reactions to things they've eaten <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> or been around <SIL> you know but um <SIL> more <SIL> i think doctors should more <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> look on that avenue <SIL> yknow <SIL> that possibly it's something else like that <SIL> i've never had a doc well now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you know about allergies and usually it's um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> prescriptions and things <SIL> you know i mean that you've taken but <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think a lot of things have to do with food allergies anymore <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i really do <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yep <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well for so long i <SIL> ate peanuts and i loved them and peanut butter and then two years ago i started getting a reaction from it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> finally i did go to the doctor because i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i was so ill from it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um and he said you're allergic <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> mainly it was the skins on <SIL> like spanish peanuts and things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i never but <SIL> my body must have built up <SIL> this reaction to it because i i was always fine eating them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then they really <SIL> turned on me so now i can't even eat <SIL> any <VOCNOISE> <SIL> peanut products <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or the oil because everybody's like well you can eat natural peanut butter and i'm like <SIL> no it's the oil in there you know they grind up the peanuts and it's the oil <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i probably had it for a long time and i was <SIL> getting sick and thinking i had the flu or something and he <IVER>
yknow i didn't realize because i used to love peanut butter <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you want toast and crackers i'd go home you know was <VOCNOISE> because it was a lot of protein for me not eating meat and it <SIL> yknow it kind of satisfied me <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <VOCNOISE> this doctor <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> took a couple tests <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he realized it was the peanuts which i would have never thought of that <SIL> because i ate it for so long <SIL> all my life <IVER>
yes <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
see and i can't eat seafood <UNKNOWN> but i <SIL> tried some once when i went to las vegas with my <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i <SIL> we didn't really have it <SIL> my mom didn't cook it at home <SIL> which i'm kind glad she didn't <SIL> um <SIL> the <SIL> smell of fish always kind of bothered me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> until i tried some crab meat and lobster <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and within five minutes <SIL> i broke out into a rash <SIL> i mean it was like a heat rash <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> oh <SIL> it started on my neck <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
is it okay i'm sorry <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
it started on my neck and went down <VOCNOISE> but it was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> automatic <SIL> and i mean they had to take me the emergency room i didn't know what it was until <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it was <SIL> and i mean you get so hot and you <VOCNOISE> you just <VOCNOISE> you're in a fever <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
