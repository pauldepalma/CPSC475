<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH_um-hum_okay> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
it's very difficult <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i don't know why <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh columbus was just stubborn about it until <VOCNOISE> the last year <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> they hadn't <ERROR-beyn_able=been_able> able to get subs fifty <CUTOFF-perc=percent> <SIL> substitutes fifty percent of the time and so the teachers were screaming <VOCNOISE> and they were splitting the kids up and putting them in other classrooms well <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know if the parents made anything about it but i guess <SIL> finally <VOCNOISE> yknow when you have fifty percent of your classrooms uncovered <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh they <SIL> came to it and it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody <VOCNOISE> the kids the principal or the other teachers but now it's like <VOCNOISE> oh thank you for coming oh thank you for coming <VOCNOISE> so i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think a lot of the retired teachers who weren't messing around with it have come back in <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i don't know exactly what to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
well <SIL> uh <SIL> when i came <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh back from oregon <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my father was very ill <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so i didn't want full time work and i started substituting out in uh licking county <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-ih=?> which <SIL> paid <CUTOFF-t=terribly> <CUTOFF-ch=?> <CUTOFF-t=terribly> terribly low <CUTOFF-the=there's> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-the=there's> there's all these little districts that has <SIL> a superintendent <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well no they have two elementaries one middle school and one high school and a superintendent which they don't need yknow <VOCNOISE> so they'd <VOCNOISE> hire <VOCNOISE> straight out of college always <VOCNOISE> and there there is a law that <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> uh you have to pay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for your accumulated time <VOCNOISE> so i couldn't get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me <SIL> for <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i came <CUTOFF-i=in> back in to columbus and it's a lot harder to work in columbus public but <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> i i know the territory i know where i'm <LAUGH-going> <LAUGH> <IVER>
the population <SIL> <CUTOFF-n=?> is much different yes <IVER>
well <CUTOFF-th=the> you have uh you have an urban area with a lot of poor children <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> a lot of single parent families and just the population is changing period <VOCNOISE> <SIL> from the uh the two parent family very <VOCNOISE> the mother not working into <SIL> one parent with the mother working it makes a big difference in how the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> child does at school <IVER>
yes it's definitely having an effect on uh children and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they aren't doing it yet <SIL> whether they will be able to pick up enough <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i don't know but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i'm glad my children went to school when they did <LAUGH> <LAUGH-and_I> stayed home with them <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH> you should be <VOCNOISE> <SIL> real attentive to what's happening in his school situation <SIL> his or her <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-w=well> you should be we're all aware because the school has a big <CUTOFF-ha=hand> <VOCNOISE> impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now <SIL> so <SIL> yknow but you can tell <SIL> how your child's doing of course <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at this point <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm not <CUTOFF-ag=against> <SIL> uh i'm not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i wouldn't <ERROR-mrv=move> <SIL> move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they are <CUTOFF-s=so> <SIL> in so uh such bad shape right now that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah <VOCNOISE> they've threatened it <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and if they don't pull their scores up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um they will <VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <CUTOFF-opin=opinion> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh well i'm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um my opinion changes from day to day on <LAUGH-whose_fault_it_is> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh actually <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at this point in time i don't know who's fault it is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i think it's the <CUTOFF-f=fault> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fault of evolution <LAUGH> well it could have been prevented but we didn't know it was gonna happen that <CUTOFF-th=that> <SIL> that our society was gonna change so intensely and we kind of <VOCNOISE> hung back and thought things would stay the same way they were and they haven't and everybody's changing and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> especially the younger people <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we weren't ready and we didn't change fast <LAUGH-enough_we_didn't_get> ready for the change that was coming <IVER>
columbus <SIL> it seems to be <LAUGH> i mean it's just like blah <LAUGH> <IVER>
i at this point i blame it on the administration <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and the citizens of columbus haven't i mean uh two years ago or was it three years ago now <VOCNOISE> they defeated a levy <VOCNOISE> you should never defeat a school levy <IVER>
yknow they never ask for extra money <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they had to cut back on everything and <CUTOFF-i=it> i think it just set people back now we're trying real hard to catch up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and at some point we're going to um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow have to put a levy on again and <CUTOFF-a=and> and <SIL> uh <SIL> who knows what's happen <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we're keeping rosa smith right now because she's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so good p r with the with the business community but the business community in columbus doesn't really support the schools <CUTOFF-i=?> they don't <SIL> i mean we've got two new uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> stadiums and we haven't got any increase in school funding <SIL>
