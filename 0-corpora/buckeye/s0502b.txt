ah <SIL> i have i've have <SIL> uh <SIL> and yknow there kids in the neighborhood and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the grownups talk and i <CUTOFF-t=talk> i talk to the kids too i there's a a girl that lives next door who i we talk a lot <VOCNOISE> she just started at um everett <SIL> the uh <SIL> arts middle school <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
boy <SIL> i <SIL> yknow <SIL> i <SIL> i don't <SIL> not having kids and then yknow not being that close to it it's hard to know <SIL> i mean i've always <SIL> i've always thought that <SIL> that <SIL> um <SIL> what their friends did <NOISE> and what they <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what they were exposed to at home <SIL> had <SIL> as much <SIL> influence as as anything that <SIL> that the school could do but i know the school <SIL> school is a very powerful force in a kid's life <SIL> yknow i mean it is a kid's life <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> with <CUTOFF-tha=that?> <SIL> no i no i am definitely in favor of that i mean <SIL> yes <SIL> it's the <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it?> the parents <SIL> is the parent is supposed to do it <SIL> and one would hope that the <SIL> parent <SIL> would get there before <SIL> before the health class did but if the parent isn't gonna get there <SIL> this is the only way they're <SIL> ever gonna <SIL> find <LAUGH-out> <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i think it is <SIL> because <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> when <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> i was a sophomore in high school before it dawned on me that tab a and slot b <LAUGH-had_any_relation> to the stuff that we were learning with the charts and the diagrams <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> but i think kids are a lot more aware now <SIL> from <SIL> <CUTOFF-c=?> because of what they're exposed to <VOCNOISE> yknow in movies and everything <CUTOFF-j=just> yknow just <SIL> tv just daily life <VOCNOISE> um either they're a lot more aware <SIL> they <SIL> they have <SIL> i <SIL> <HES-I> <HES-they> they go into it with a lot of <VOCNOISE> of uh myths and misapprehensions <SIL> but they definitely have thoughts about it <SIL> and and <SIL> i think they i think they need to <LAUGH-know> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i well <SIL> yknow i <CUTOFF-d=don't> <SIL> i don't see how we can say <SIL> <HES-I i mean <SIL> we can <CUTOFF-refuse> <SIL> refuse to <CUTOFF-see> <SIL> to see certain classes <SIL> of <SIL> movies or <SIL> or watch <SIL> certain classes of shows but i <SIL> yknow without getting into that first amendment thing i can't <SIL> yknow i don't see how we can <SIL> have a code of conduct <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> boy i don't know <SIL> i'm <SIL> i'm <SIL> yknow i've <VOCNOISE> never seen it happen in <SIL> in my lifetime <SIL> yknow <SIL> so i <CUTOFF-do=don't> i don't know if it could be but then of course it can't go on the same way <SIL> <CUTOFF-forev=forever> yknow it can't <SIL> keep <SIL> <LAUGH-progressing> <VOCNOISE> i don't <SIL> think <IVER>
the <LAUGH-naked> weather girl <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-we=well it it <IVER>
<HES-it> it makes me wonder because <SIL> um <SIL> i don't <SIL> i don't see a lot of movies so a lot of this is yknow just <SIL> from reading reviews and stuff <SIL> but it seems like <SIL> yknow <SIL> last <SIL> last year two explosions would do the <SIL> job this year you gotta have five explosions <SIL> and two car <SIL> chases <SIL> and and mutilated bodies <SIL> yknow it's it <SIL> just seems like <SIL> it <SIL> it <SIL> you need more and more sensationalism to <SIL> sell your <SIL> to sell your <SIL> product and uh <SIL> it's scary <SIL> <SIL> <HES-I> <SIL> it's <CUTOFF-r=really> <SIL> it's really hard to do <SIL> to <SIL> to <SIL> talk about <SIL> morals <SIL> um without <SIL> bringing <SIL> uh yknow <SIL> religious background or something into it i think <SIL> i think <SIL> ah <SIL> the way the schools should approach it <LAUGH-is_that> <SIL> if you get pregnant it's gonna ruin your life so you don't want to do that <SIL> do you <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow_that> sort of thing <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> boy that's a <SIL> that's a really tough one <SIL> i hadn't i hadn't thought about <SIL> that and and <SIL> high school kids are so <SIL> touchy about <SIL> i mean <SIL> about <SIL> touchy about sexual identity and <SIL> and so likely <CUTOFF-th=that?> yknow so insecure in their own that they're really <SIL> likely to come down hard on somebody <SIL> who has a has a different orientation <VOCNOISE> and i <CUTOFF-do=don't> i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah you can't ignore it <SIL> i <CUTOFF-m=mean?> <SIL> because <CUTOFF-be=because> <SIL> yknow because that's <SIL> something else when i was in high school i <CUTOFF-d=don't> <SIL> don't <SIL> think <VOCNOISE> i knew the word <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> now <CUTOFF-everyb=everybody> <SIL> everybody knows <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> anybody who's a little bit different is likely to be called a faggot <LAUGH> and and <VOCNOISE> so it's <SIL> better if you can diffuse that but <SIL> i <CUTOFF-w=wouldn't> boy i wouldn't know <SIL> how to approach it <SIL> i mean i think it should be approached <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i wouldn't have a clue <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i think <SIL> i think they should <SIL> um <SIL> i <SIL> think a lot of the fear of this material comes <SIL> uh <SIL> from people who hold the belief that <SIL> that <SIL> you choose <SIL> your orientation <VOCNOISE> that you can be converted <SIL> to homosexuality and i <SIL> personally don't believe that so it <SIL> i yknow i'm not afraid <SIL> of it <SIL> but i can see how <SIL> people would hold the opposite view <SIL> and that i that's where this <ERROR-comefmi=comes_from> comes from but <SIL> since i think they're wrong <LAUGH> <SIL> i think it should be my way <SIL> and i think i think yknow <CUTOFF-th=the> i think the material should be there <SIL> i think it <CUTOFF-sh=should> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow dealt with in a calm and reasonable way <SIL> and i think it should be accessible to the kids <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> i <SIL> think <SIL> i think it's <CUTOFF-f=fair> i think it's fair i think it should be <SIL> that domestic partners <SIL> should be <SIL> should be covered <VOCNOISE> i think there should probably be some <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow some <CUTOFF-r=restrictions> some restrictions there should <SIL> be some level of
