<IVER>
she has <SIL> no she hasn't worked since <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my sister megan was born and megan is twenty <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she but the thing is i've got another i've got a <CUTOFF-s=sister> <HES-a> sister my sister megan <HES-um> <EXT-Joe> is my brother he's fifteen and a half and then i have a sister vanessa who's twelve <IVER>
so i mean <SIL> it's not like there aren't young kids still there i mean and she does stuff like <VOCNOISE> lots of things with school yknow she runs all the school candy sales and she does like lots of p t a she was p t a president <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> she also likes to remodel houses so if there's a house that comes up she'll buy it and fix it up and <VOCNOISE> and yknow she makes <SIL> yknow twenty thousand dollars a year <SIL> <VOCNOISE> on the side doing that she likes to do it and <IVER>
she figures well yknow that kind of makes up for me not working <CUTOFF-s=so> <HES-so> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah it's true and she likes it she's really good at it and <SIL> <HES-and> drives my <CUTOFF-s=stepdad> <SIL> my stepdad <LAUGH-crazy> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-because> because she'll always be like <VOCNOISE> hey pete can you come over and put these cabinets <LAUGH-in_yknow> he says i don't wanna do <LAUGH-anything_else> <SIL> but um <IVER>
she no she <CUTOFF-sh=she> <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> she's kinda the <CUTOFF-d=?> well she does all the painting and wallpapering and like all that kind of stuff but as far as the carpentry work we have <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> this one guy that's been doing stuff for our house for a long time or <IVER>
she'll make <SIL> she'll make pete go over and do it <LAUGH> <LAUGH-not_like_he_has_a_lot_of_choice> <LAUGH> no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <IVER>
usually clintonville my mom <VOCNOISE> she um <SIL> she doesn't she's not a big fan of driving <VOCNOISE> she doesn't really drive very much which is good i've ridden in a car with her one time and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it just she just would prefer not to and <HES-we> that's okay with us because she's she's got a drivers license for i d and those types of things but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for the most part so she kinda stays like clintonville area <IVER>
which is <HES-um> <SIL> which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of roses <VOCNOISE> and those <NOISE-types> of things you can get some that are <VOCNOISE> older that need <VOCNOISE> <HES-that> need a lot of work but that's a pretty high demand area <IVER>
so <SIL> that works out pretty well <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah so that's pretty much what she likes to do <IVER>
yeah <SIL> it is it's nice <SIL> it works out well <IVER>
my mom <IVER>
yeah she's <LAUGH-already> <LAUGH> i didn't think she'd have it any other way <IVER>
<LAUGH> well the thing <HES-I> mean i know when my mom <VOCNOISE> my mom has a friend that adopted <IVER>
a baby <SIL> um a biracial baby which <CUTOFF-w=worked> <SIL> worked out well he is <CUTOFF-ji=just> just is the sweetest kid in the whole world <VOCNOISE> and <HES-uh> <SIL> um <SIL> and my mom's friend colin is a teacher and she watched jessie for <VOCNOISE> a good three year during the <CUTOFF-da=day> i mean oh colin paid her obviously <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i mean and she really she really enjoyed that yknow something that she could do at home yknow she wanted to go out and run errands she could take jessie with her <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> and that was <CUTOFF-ha=?> and that worked out well <VOCNOISE> but i think too like with my school schedule yknow if i'm just in class <VOCNOISE> maybe <VOCNOISE> yknow three four days a week <VOCNOISE> and then the rest the time in the evening jason will be there so it's not like i'm relying on her <VOCNOISE> every single day <CUTOFF-a=all> <VOCNOISE> all the time to do that and i really wouldn't wanna put my child in daycare <IVER>
that would just be too scary for me <IVER>
really <IVER>
<EXT-um> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> how'd you do this to <LAUGH-me> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
does it <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
em <VOCNOISE> aw that's nice <VOCNOISE> yeah i'm sure <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
i think sometimes you there's a tradeoff between <VOCNOISE> time and money and you just have to look at it and say which is really more important <IVER>
absolutely <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i know that they changed it i know that it used to just be one day i guess because of the healthcare <VOCNOISE> something like that <HES-I> <HES-I> i feel like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a day and a half certainly would be long enough for me i mean unless there's some type of complications <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i would be <LAUGH-perfectly_ready_to_go_home> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-unle=unless> unless there's something extra that they could do for me there <IVER>
and <HES-and> then i would expect that if there was a problem that they would make sure <CUTOFF-tha=that> that they kept me there but i think a day and a half is perfectly reasonable <VOCNOISE> i mean i <HES-don't> <SIL> i don't <CUTOFF-n=know> <SIL> i don't know i've never done this <LAUGH-before_so> i can't really say <VOCNOISE> but i mean <VOCNOISE> my feeling is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the least <LAUGH-amount_of_time> i have to be in the hospital <LAUGH-the_happier_i'm_gonna_be> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah that's true well we <CUTOFF-wen=went> o s u's and they've got a nice facility i mean they have uh <VOCNOISE> uh <CUTOFF-d=?> uh <CUTOFF-wv=?> <SIL> like a labor and delivery room it's got like <VOCNOISE> it's weird though because when you go they show you they they talk about all this whirlpool bath thing a room with it i don't know if you've heard those commercials or not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <CUTOFF-there=there's> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's only one room that's like that <IVER>
and it's <SIL> interesting that they <SIL> advertise that when you go there though <VOCNOISE> if you get that room that's what you get <IVER>
if not you just get the <CUTOFF-re=regular> <VOCNOISE> the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff <VOCNOISE> but it's <SIL> interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like <VOCNOISE> there's this huge place and you're gonna get that no matter <EXT-what> and this and that <VOCNOISE> but when you actually go and look around it kind of <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
little different <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-it=it> <IVER>
yeah it's well basically it's like a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's about the size of a <ERROR-s=small> very small hotel room and then it's got a separate bathroom with like a big bathtub <VOCNOISE> and there's like <HES-a> they there like oh it's aroma therapy which is a little box on the wall about this big that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean there's enough room where people can come and sit down there's like a fold out <VOCNOISE> couch bed for whoever's in there with you and then they've got the baby <VOCNOISE> they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it's born <IVER>
which i think is kinda nice <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-mea=mean> <HES-it> looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable <VOCNOISE> i mean my biggest thing is i just wanna have a room to all myself yknow i don't wanna go some place where i'm gonna <LAUGH-have> to like deal with <LAUGH-somebody_else_in_there> <VOCNOISE> so i mean it looks <SIL> it looks nice but <VOCNOISE> i would be more comfortable at home i think once i go home <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i figure <VOCNOISE> there'll be plenty of <CUTOFF-pe=people> i told my mom i just want green jello you <LAUGH-just> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-she's_gonna_make_me_snacks> <LAUGH> oh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know it just sounds like it would be something that i would have to have it's just necessary <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <IVER>
really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
to the other side <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i'm <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
no that's interesting though because i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think <HES-that> <HES-um> that my whole <HES-I> i mean i always still <CUTOFF-fuh=feel> i still feel like i'm <EXT-just> <IVER>
yknow i'm just one of the kids hi mom yknow <VOCNOISE> yknow <HES-and> <HES-and> i guess it's true and i've always wondered <VOCNOISE> yknow i turned eighteen and i thought <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well shouldn't i feel like an adult now <VOCNOISE> yknow i was twenty one shouldn't i start to feel like this responsible twenty five shouldn't i be an adult <VOCNOISE> yknow and i wonder <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at what point do you really feel like you're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you are on that other side or you're one of the grown up people instead of one of the little <NOISE-people> and maybe <VOCNOISE> <SIL> maybe that's maybe that's one i mean <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH-I_don't_it_is> <LAUGH> well that's fair maybe that's true too i mean i don't feel <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> because you know when you're younger you think oh my god twenty seven <VOCNOISE> that's so old you must be yknow and now that you're here you're like guys i <CUTOFF-z=feel> <SIL> i feel fine i don't feel <LAUGH-like> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-right> <LAUGH> little more responsible but other than <LAUGH-that> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
really <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
huh <VOCNOISE> i have to wait i guess a couple weeks i'll be <LAUGH-having_to_tell_you> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well the thing is in lamaze they show you those <CUTOFF-ta=tapes?> i'm sure you guys took those classes <VOCNOISE> they're horrible they take seventeen hours of labor they put it into six minutes and you think <VOCNOISE> oh my <EXT-God> i'm gonna <EXT-die> yknow these women are like i just want to die <LAUGH-you_know_and_you're_like> why are you showing me <CUTOFF-thi-this> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i said <HES-I> didn't want to see that yknow i would much rather just <VOCNOISE> have my own opinion of what it's gonna be like yknow and go by <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what other people said
