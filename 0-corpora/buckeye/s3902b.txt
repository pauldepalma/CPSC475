<SIL> let's see <SIL> usually go out to <VOCNOISE> lunch at like <HES-some> <SIL> fast food place <VOCNOISE> and then we get together and cook dinner <IVER>
yeah we have a little kitchen <IVER>
uh i've learned a lot about cooking <SIL> lately <LAUGH> <IVER>
<HES-yeah> <VOCNOISE> i i thought <SIL> in the beginning i missed mirror lake cafe so bad because the good subs and all that <VOCNOISE> i don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know why i missed them i don't <VOCNOISE> i go back and now i just don't like it anymore <IVER>
yeah i've been thoroughly spoiled yknow like catfish biff subs those are <LAUGH-good> <IVER>
oh <CUTOFF-the=they're> <VOCNOISE> they're very good <SIL> like you call <VOCNOISE> i usually just call and then i walk down and by the time i get there <VOCNOISE> the subs are ready <IVER>
oh is it <VOCNOISE> it's a little farther <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
no not really <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i don't know what even is to eat down here <SIL> oxleys <LAUGH> <IVER>
oxleys is probably the <VOCNOISE> closest place <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and those little hot dog stands <SIL> those really don't count <IVER>
which one is that <IVER>
<EXT-oh> yeah <VOCNOISE> adriatico's <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> mondays and tuesdays <SIL> they have <HES-the> <SIL> cheap pizza <IVER>
yeah they have a deal <EXT-on> monday and tuesday i think it's like after five p m <IVER>
the <SIL> <CUTOFF-ch=cheap?> <SIL> pizzas really cheap <IVER>
<EXT-oh> <NOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah that wouldn't work <LAUGH> <IVER>
our dorms were cleaner <IVER>
our our janitor is worthless <LAUGH-um> <VOCNOISE> basically it <HES-um> we were complaining about it like earlier during the year <SIL> three complaints have uh formal complaints <SIL> have been filed against him and he still refuses to change the bleach water <SIL> like more than once a week <VOCNOISE> it's really <SIL> disgusting <VOCNOISE> so we had these temps come in one day and it was <SIL> we went in uh like we're in shock it was so clean <IVER>
they did they didn't come every <EXT-day> but yknow they came occasionally and it helped and <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> we mopped our own floor like on the hall a few times it we just basically need the <SIL> bathrooms done <IVER>
yknow and i wouldn't be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here <IVER>
you know <VOCNOISE> i don't <IVER>
<HES-and> <VOCNOISE> i don't know commons i don't i didn't miss bus service i kind of missed because <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> aaron's car is out <SIL> on west campus but <VOCNOISE> i went home and got my dad's a <LAUGH-pass> <LAUGH> he teaches in the dental school but he only teaches on fridays <SIL> so he has that a pass available all the time <LAUGH> so our car is parked <EXT-right> next to the building <IVER>
yeah we're gonna have to give it up by friday <VOCNOISE> because <SIL> the strike's over they won't let us keep it <SIL> anymore <IVER>
oh i wish yeah i do it during summer too i usually work down here <IVER>
just over summer and i use the a pass <VOCNOISE> and then i drive my dad down on fridays <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i <CUTOFF-thi=think> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> they're justified to go on strike anytime they want to however how they <SIL> behaved during the strike was just <EXT-disgusting> i mean <IVER>
like sitting out <HES-on> the street all the time like <SIL> uh <SIL> honking the horns ringing the bells doing the <EXT-whistles> the <VOCNOISE> really annoying chants um <VOCNOISE> i had classes in the b and z <SIL> building <VOCNOISE> that we just had to cancel because they were too loud <IVER>
um <SIL> yeah across streets the dental <SIL> and the hospital <VOCNOISE> so people were really loud down there <IVER>
and we couldn't have class <HES-and> <SIL> in addition they were like trying to tip over buses and throwing stones at them <IVER>
when they drove by i guess <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there's no need to attack students over it and <SIL> i read some article <VOCNOISE> in the lantern i don't know why i read that but um <VOCNOISE> i hate that paper but anyway <VOCNOISE> um i read some article that the guy said he's not trying to attack students he just wants them to get annoyed so they'll <EXT-go> whine to their parents about how the university does it <VOCNOISE> and then they can all fight the establishment and <SIL> <IVER>
it makes me <SIL> angry that people like that even get <SIL> money <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no it didn't as a matter of fact i told my parents yknow <NOISE> university is handling it <VOCNOISE> so well by <EXT-not> <VOCNOISE> giving them the money because they don't deserve it <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
yeah <HES-and> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was just <HES-really> <SIL> disgusting how they <EXT-behaved> <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> a lot of yelling at <EXT-students> <SIL> <HES-and> that was <EXT-really> unnecessary <SIL> i they <VOCNOISE> just totally approached it from the wrong <SIL> point and <VOCNOISE> i mean there were some students that actually <HES-were> <SIL> supporting them <IVER>
and they were being very vocal about it but the vast majority of people that i <SIL> talked to <VOCNOISE> were so against the strikers <IVER>
yeah they were <CUTOFF-f=for?> pro strike were getting money on buck i d's but yeah <IVER>
we wanted it to keep on going <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> <HES-it> <VOCNOISE> they just didn't need to <SIL> do like that and then i think once they noticed that the uh <VOCNOISE> commons were gonna open without them they realized that <SIL> university is functioning <SIL> or was functioning fine without them <IVER>
and decided to go back to their jobs <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=if> if you noticed the first time that they voted <VOCNOISE> they voted down this proposal the proposal that their voting on this week is the exact same one <IVER>
uh nobody really admits it but <VOCNOISE> oh i grabbed the paper because i wanted to see what the agreement was and it's pretty much the same thing <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> <EXT-they're> <SIL> voting positively for it this time <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i wouldn't <IVER>
i wouldn't doubt it <SIL> i hope they vote against it but i don't think they will <IVER>
just because it's been <SIL> three weeks now yknow and <VOCNOISE> not <SIL> only that there's uh something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and <EXT-the> union has to pay their full wages for the work that they miss <IVER>
<HES-and> <SIL> union's not gonna do that <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
hm <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i just think you can't <VOCNOISE> you can't call for across the board <VOCNOISE> raises there definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than what they're getting <IVER>
and there are some people that deserve to be fired <SIL> and there's no way that you can really <SIL> differentiate just because they're in a union they <IVER>
take that <EXT-away> <IVER>
<HES-and> <SIL> it's really unfortunate for the good workers in there because <VOCNOISE> i mean the people at mirror lake are so <EXT-great> <IVER>
yeah they're all <EXT-really> <HES-nice> <SIL> <IVER>
yknow and <HES-they> <VOCNOISE> work hard <VOCNOISE> yknow to make it <SIL> easier on the students <VOCNOISE> yknow totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year <IVER>
just to make it easier on everybody <IVER>
<NOISE> it's good place <VOCNOISE> they even stopped playing the ghetto music <LAUGH> they had this jukebox and it was <EXT-horrible> they played the same three songs with like horribly offensive lyrics and <HES-no> <VOCNOISE> melody whatsoever <IVER>
<HES-and> <SIL> they stopped doing that now <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah probably <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> i just think <SIL> <HES-it's> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> horribly biased paper they don't <SIL> really take their <HES-uh> <SIL> what is it <HES-uh> <SIL> <HES-the> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-journalistic> <SIL> like <SIL> <EXT-unbiased> <VOCNOISE> integrity they don't take that seriously <IVER>
oh it's most of it is liberal <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <HES-they've> <SIL> always find some way <HES-to> <SIL> misrepresent <SIL> like <SIL> <HES-uh> kirwan <IVER>
they always find some <VOCNOISE> silly way to slant his words and make him <EXT-look> bad and <VOCNOISE> it's really disgusting i <LAUGH-mean> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <HES-and> <SIL> since it's not <SIL> <HES-um> <SIL> sponsored officially by <EXT-the> <SIL> <HES-um> <SIL> university they can do whatever they want and they don't have any <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <EXT-possibility> <EXT-of> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i'm looking for a word here <LAUGH> uh repercussions <IVER>
no they're not it's printed at the top every <SIL> on every issue <SIL> that they are <SIL> financially <CUTOFF-s=seperate?> independent <IVER>
so therefore they can <SIL> they're not public they can put whatever they want <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i am during different points of the day <LAUGH-I_don't_know> <IVER>
<HES-um> <SIL> as far as affiliated with <VOCNOISE> a party <VOCNOISE> i <EXT-probably> <VOCNOISE> respond <EXT-to> <SIL> <HES-um> <SIL> republicans more than democrats <HES-but> <VOCNOISE> i think given any <SIL> um <SIL> given any choice of any <SIL> party <SIL> at all <VOCNOISE> i'm probably more libertarian than anything else <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> just <VOCNOISE> yknow it's <SIL> let people make their own mistakes and then <SIL> but don't make me pay for it yeah
