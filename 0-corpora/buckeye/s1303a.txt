<SIL> <VOCNOISE> is that <SIL> the way jesus christ would have brought that here <SIL> well some people have their opinion and i said no <SIL> no <SIL> i say you you wear that collar <SIL> you do something about that if you don't <VOCNOISE> then i realize what a spineless person you are <SIL> but you'll never find me in your church again <SIL> so i've done what i've done but <VOCNOISE> there's a lot of people out there that'll read a book on native american spirituality <VOCNOISE> and they'll become self proclaimed spiritual leaders <SIL> uh they'll learn the sweats there's some people that have taken pictures of sweat lodges which you're not supposed to do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh they show step by step how to build one <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and tell <EXT-word_you> <SIL> that some kind of wood to build it out of <EXT-and> ninety percent of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um there's a way to do it <VOCNOISE> and there's a way to do it uh <SIL> it has to be done that way traditionally there was a reason for that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> because the people of this land were given specific instructions <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> from their creator through visions <VOCNOISE> through a woman called the <CUTOFF-bu=buffalo> white buffalo calf woman that came to the people and brought them <VOCNOISE> these ceremonies like the sweat lodge <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they brought them the sacred pipe <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's not a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not a belief thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a way of life <SIL> and it's a way of life that's still in danger of being snuffed out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but it won't be <SIL> it's just <SIL> it won't be <SIL> it's just we gotta be careful about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh how and what you do and if you look <EXT-yknow> native american spirituality or religion for lack of a better word <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah because our people believe that religion you can't uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you can't encompass one word <EXT-everything> that is in the one word <IVER>
<SIL> all of creation <SIL> into religion <SIL> all of what spirituality is into one word religion <HES-you> you can't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but when you say it's a <CUTOFF-spiritual> of spiritual nature <SIL> that's <SIL> yknow that's still leaving the door wide open that it's it's broad it's bigger than you or me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but that ah <SIL> that whole thing is um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow the people of the land had a <CUTOFF-sp=specific> a specific instructions <SIL> on how to do things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i i'm not saying they were perfect either <SIL> there were a lot of indian people and there are a lot of indian people out there that are crooked as a dog's hind leg <VOCNOISE> that's just the way it is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they're corrupt the money has corrupt them the lack of money has corrupted them power has corrupted them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um they wanna be a spiritual leader why i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to me it's an ego thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh this rainbow eagle guy had some kind of buffalo uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what do you call it a <EXT-buffalo> ceremony <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but he charged everybody <SIL> native people don't do that <SIL> i mean <SIL> traditional native people <CUTOFF-th=they> <SIL> <HES-you> <SIL> you don't charge people that wanna come learn about god <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's some people in california <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that say certain ceremonies were a native <SIL> thing and they buried a woman in the ground with a straw <VOCNOISE> told her it was some ritual of proving and over coming fear <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yet the lady was an asthmatic and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in her mouth and she couldn't breath and breathed in all the sand and died <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so the first thing they put in the paper is that another native ceremony shows us how <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> native american spirituality should be <SIL> outlawed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and if you look at any kind of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh spirituality religion that's out there native americans are only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can't have <VOCNOISE> that there's blood quantums <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> saying that if you have a fourth <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or a half <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and even <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you had two full bloods <SIL> from two different tribes <SIL> and they had a child <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the federal government still considers them a half blood <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> why i don't know <SIL> doesn't make sense <IVER>
<SIL> but the federal government and their lawyers have done that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the department of the interior <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> still considers native americans <SIL> <VOCNOISE> on the same level as a dog <SIL> they don't have <SIL> something wrong there <SIL> and that still goes on today after about six hundred years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and we got good people in this country that wanna do something about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but unfortunately <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=they> <EXT-yknow> what i'm finding <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> you got everybody's gotta choose their path <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there's the ones that'll get out there with their picket signs <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and raise hell <SIL> okay <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> me i don't wanna go to <UNKNOWN> jail and get arrested because i feel i won't do my people <SIL> any service by being in jail <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> but there are those that are out there that are <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> willing to do that <IVER>
warriors that are out there men and women that'll do that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh more power to them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> all i can do is pray about it <SIL> and that's what i suggest to everybody else <VOCNOISE> that's the most powerful thing that you can do <SIL> even one of the <EXT-nuns> <VOCNOISE> in high school <SIL> that taught me had a poster on the wall that said <SIL> <SIL> <SIL> <EXT-more> things are wrought in this world by prayer <SIL> then we'll ever know <IVER>
and that's true <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so that's the most powerful thing i can do <SIL> when i can turn it over to god and say god this is too damn big for me to handle <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you think you can work on maybe helping change this person's heart <VOCNOISE> or their mind <SIL> because i can't do that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> so <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i didn't mean to get <LAUGH-off_on_a_tangent_there> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<HES-in> <HES-in> much <HES-in> much other things <SIL> yknow that i'm <SIL> <UNKNOWN> coming to understand <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there's uh <SIL> yknow i just uh is <VOCNOISE> i had three spiritual leaders <SIL> tell me that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a great gift came with that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that there was it was no accident <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was supposed to happen <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh there's a word called synchronicity <IVER>
that um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> encompasses the <VOCNOISE> uh theory that <SIL> all things happen for a reason <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> even though it seems like it's chaos <SIL> even though it seems like it's an accident <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a flow <SIL> of spirit in this world things <SIL> are moving <SIL> at a pace that they're supposed to move at <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and things happen <SIL> and death is part of life <SIL> physical death <SIL> and that's one of the things i also learned through this was that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you don't die <SIL> you don't <SIL> physically <SIL> maybe <SIL> yknow <SIL> there's no denying that <SIL> but <SIL> spiritually <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not even physical death can break that <SIL> it won't <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-yeah> <SIL> and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people <SIL> i mean actually seeing <SIL> spirits <SIL> in other people in terms of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul <SIL> that's very true <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i could see <SIL> in certain people's <EXT-eyes> when i was in the hospital <SIL> the confusion <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-the> <SIL> unsure <SIL> feelings <SIL> yknow the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <SIL> i didn't there's something that i could see there that i can't explain and i still can't explain it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just <EXT-know> what i <EXT-see> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then i go and try and tell the psychologist psychiatrist well they want to put me on some kind of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> anti hallucinogenic <SIL> medication and i said well listen man <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm not hallucinating <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and these people that hear voices <VOCNOISE> they're not hallucinating <SIL> they're hearing voices of spirits <SIL> and in many cultures they'll tell you most the indigenous cultures <VOCNOISE> throughout the world will tell you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the history will show <VOCNOISE> that those people were revered as gifted <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> this is the only society <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <SIL> labels them <SIL> mentally ill <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <EXT-because> largely because of the fear of not knowing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and not knowing how to deal with the unseen <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah he did <IVER>
<SIL> there's no doubt in my mind that he <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> heard those voices now whether they were actual <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> audible voices <SIL> or <SIL> whether they were voices from the inside <IVER>
in his own mind <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> regardless it's part of that bad spirit that people have created <SIL> not the devil <SIL> not satan <SIL> to the native people he doesn't <EXT-exist> <SIL> and to me he doesn't exist <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's a piece of shit <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but he's real <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> and he's real because people give him that <IVER>
<SIL> they believe in him <SIL> they empower that <SIL> that <EXT-fear> of him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> empowers it <SIL> his existence <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when you got like minded people around yknow <SIL> <SIL> <SIL> you can create a spirit <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> a bad one <SIL> or a good one <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> this boy <SIL> <VOCNOISE> whatever he did <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> yeah there's no doubt in my mind that he either heard <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> internal voices or <SIL> ah actual audible voices of spirits that were <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah <SIL> misguided spirits <IVER>
while they were here <SIL> there are many people that were bad eggs man <SIL>
