<IVER>
yeah <IVER>
it depends on what area you live in too <VOCNOISE> the area where i live in you get <VOCNOISE> little house <VOCNOISE> because you're close to everything <VOCNOISE> whereas you get kind of farther away from the center of <SIL> the area you can get a bigger house and <VOCNOISE> there's some really really pretty ones <IVER>
yeah and um the <CUTOFF-en=?> <VOCNOISE> the uh smaller house like <SIL> bigger squished in areas <VOCNOISE> are <NOISE> uh the older area <IVER>
and then as the <VOCNOISE> community fanned out then <VOCNOISE> they had bigger houses <VOCNOISE> i like living in the old area better <VOCNOISE> i like the houses in the new area better <VOCNOISE> there's one in particular that's just <VOCNOISE> gorgeous <IVER>
they have this <VOCNOISE> entrance and there are these trees on the inside of the house they're just growing down into everything and there are like crystals and they have this one room that looks like a sphinx and then they have <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> this backyard that looks all yknow cute <VOCNOISE> old england <VOCNOISE> it's really really cool house <IVER>
has this little bridge that goes up to the front door <VOCNOISE> and a creek i <LAULGH-mean_it's_cool> <IVER>
um yes some of the guys from venturing crew live there <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah we did <VOCNOISE> we had a um they called lan parties <VOCNOISE> they are parties where everybody takes their computer and you hook'em up to <CUTOFF-n=?> into a network and then you play games <IVER>
yknow we had one of the parties up there and <VOCNOISE> they had this <VOCNOISE> um big like pyramid shaped thing <VOCNOISE> i i forget what they call it <VOCNOISE> it's like a crystal something <VOCNOISE> i don't know but they have a speaker hook up to it <VOCNOISE> and the structure of it makes the sound resonate like crazy <VOCNOISE> they have subwoofers sitting under it and there's this bed in the middle so i ended up falling asleep there one night <VOCNOISE> somebody woke me up with the music ah <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh it's <VOCNOISE> yeah it's definitely weird <IVER>
it's really cool <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
very new age <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> got a few ideas <VOCNOISE> um i'm thinking i might be a o b g y n just <IVER>
they need a lot of women in that field <VOCNOISE> yknow they needs <VOCNOISE> good people there <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the money didn't hurt <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> just <IVER>
it's good money <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um one idea that i've just had recently is medical informatist <VOCNOISE> which <VOCNOISE> is a person who has an m d <VOCNOISE> and does computers <VOCNOISE> since those are my two main interests i thought <VOCNOISE> doing both would be really cool <IVER>
and i'm meeting with someone on thursday actually who's <VOCNOISE> in that field <VOCNOISE> it's really just an open field <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
uh it's <IVER>
it is where bioinformatics was about a year or two ago <IVER>
just really starting to get started and i mean <VOCNOISE> somebody <VOCNOISE> you have an m d that's enough yknow you want somebody who has computer skills as well <VOCNOISE> that's <IVER>
difficult to find <IVER>
yeah the other way around is probably even harder <LAUGH> <IVER>
it does <IVER>
yeah you just see like <VOCNOISE> all the different kinds <VOCNOISE> i think even if i don't want to go into it yknow <VOCNOISE> rotations in every single <VOCNOISE> area will be interesting like <VOCNOISE> i shadowed in the uh <VOCNOISE> psych ward last week <VOCNOISE> and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that was really interesting <VOCNOISE> and i have feeling i'm gonna love my rotation but i <VOCNOISE> don't want to be a psychiatrist <IVER>
no as for it was kind of disturbing actually <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah i saw the patients in the morning <IVER>
yep <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh um well i thought about being a medical scientist <VOCNOISE> with m d p h d they do um <VOCNOISE> research <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> with applications to medicine but more in the <VOCNOISE> biochemistry field <VOCNOISE> or genetics or something like that <IVER>
that <VOCNOISE> that would be seriously fun <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> uh it depends if you work industry you get money <IVER>
if you work at a college <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> a hospital you make <VOCNOISE> no money <VOCNOISE> yeah pretty much <VOCNOISE> it seems like it <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i wanted to for a long time now i'm just not so sure that i want the <VOCNOISE> two or three more years of school <VOCNOISE> they suggest two to three years for your p h d like <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna do that <IVER>
too much <IVER>
um yeah <VOCNOISE> that's <VOCNOISE> what they suggest doing is two years of med school <VOCNOISE> get your p h d <SIL> and then do your <SIL> last two years of med school <IVER>
and then you do <VOCNOISE> your residency <VOCNOISE> you don't have to do a residency but <SIL> if you ever wanna <VOCNOISE> go clinical <VOCNOISE> you have to do it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah just ridiculous amounts of stuff i'm like i don't wanna do that <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i would be at least thirty maybe looking uh towards forty before i have the experience really necessary <VOCNOISE> to get into good jobs like <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna be i mean like <VOCNOISE> my <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> venturing crew <VOCNOISE> advisor is thirty eight and retired i mean <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i i'm going more for there <LAUGH> <IVER>
um a lot of good investments a lot of saving <VOCNOISE> a lot of living well below means <VOCNOISE> and i wanna own six businesses <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah um his definition of <VOCNOISE> retired is basically um <SIL> he doesn't have to work <VOCNOISE> he does but he doesn't have to so <VOCNOISE> he just finished up a temp job up at uh qwest <VOCNOISE> yep i think he gets paid like three seventy five an hour now <IVER>
yeah that's how he gets so much money he says <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> will be paid this much <VOCNOISE> and i will be given this many um had this much minimum per day <VOCNOISE> or i'm not working for you and <VOCNOISE> they usually say no no no we won't do that yknow and then they'll call back a week later <VOCNOISE> okay we'll take you <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> he has some really good stories about that <VOCNOISE> oh yeah <VOCNOISE> he has qualifications businesses and also with uh unix <VOCNOISE> which is <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i don't know do you know anything about unix <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> yeah he does <IVER>
i think he specializes in like solaris and h p u x <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
yeah he says he knows <VOCNOISE> the v m s as well but <SIL> he doesn't like to do it so he doesn't do it <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah he's teaching us uh system five <VOCNOISE> it's <LAUGH-just_funny> <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> like two now <IVER>
okay <IVER>
