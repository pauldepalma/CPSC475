t v about and everything that stuff's been going on for years so <SIL> <IVER>
um hum <SIL> <IVER>
well i think it's more <SIL> capable of being violent because of the uh <SIL> information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> before you know if somebody got mad at somebody you know you <VOCNOISE> might <SIL> they might shoot them or something but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not <EXT-kill> a hundred innocent people for no reason <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i i personally don't because uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i've seen maybe not to the degree of the violence but mean i still knew it was violent uh <SIL> stuff when i was kid you know that didn't make me a violent person <SIL> so <IVER>
<SIL> i think that's a cop out myself <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i wish i knew the answer uh <SIL> but <SIL> the reality you know uh <SIL> i just feel sorry for the the people <CUTOFF-w=?> that not only feel that they have to do that <SIL> but <ERROR> and also for the people that <SIL> are involved in it on the other those victims and everything and their parents and everything <VOCNOISE> the only one i really had a <VOCNOISE> i was really upset with uh was the columbine deal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that was because uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the one kid <SIL> was making bombs and stuff like that in the basement and the parents <HES-knew> nothing about or or they did they didn't even think anything about and i don't think that behavior <SIL> it's uh appropriate for a <SIL> sixteen seventeen year old kid <SIL> um <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and but you know that there and goes back to uh <VOCNOISE> you know the quality or the quantity i mean if <SIL> obviously this <SIL> poor kid you know apparently <VOCNOISE> was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs in basement to <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to <SIL> figure out some way of uh <SIL> reaching his <VOCNOISE> <SIL> nirvana or whatever you know and uh <SIL> then his parents didn't have a clue <SIL> or if they did they didn't care you know <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
hum um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
hum um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-mah=?> <CUTOFF-y=yknow?> well <VOCNOISE> nowadays <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> i grew up my dad hunted and everything you know so we had always had uh <SIL> guns in the house and everything you know but uh <SIL> you know i wouldn't <SIL> no more <UNKNOWN> go <SIL> near one unless he was around because i uh <VOCNOISE> i was told not to you know <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> they they always used to say you know if you if you stop letting <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh normal people get a gun and the criminals will always have a gun well obviously that's not true you know <SIL> uh <SIL> my personal belief is that we have the right to bear arms <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> if you're of a legal age and everything i'm not really sure the background checks <SIL> really do that great of a job <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> how they going to how are they going to judge <SIL> how they going to <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> make sure the lock is on a gun i mean <SIL> that just seems like a waste of money to me <SIL> all you're doing is <CUTOFF-get=getting> letting a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a company <VOCNOISE> sell a a trigger lock <SIL> for a gun <SIL> or and make it make the guy make somebody have to buy one <VOCNOISE> but you're not going make you put it on the gun so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> just seems like a waste of <SIL> legislation <VOCNOISE> money <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well <HES-the> <HES-the> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> definitely this happened to me when i was in the <SIL> third grade uh a friend of uh two of our friends were uh <SIL> uh <SIL> went home after school we were playing with a gun and everything and one uh one of them shot and killed the other one yknow accidentally <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> it just goes to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow my dad always had a gun he <HES-didn't> didn't have it locked up all the time but yknow wasn't necessarily in the same place all the time either yknow i mean so <VOCNOISE> if you weren't really looking for it <SIL> and you know ah you <CUTOFF-hap=happen> to <CUTOFF-happenstan=happenstance> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> happenstance on to it or something you know uh <SIL> uh <SIL> i believe nowadays you know that <VOCNOISE> perhaps with the uh with the <SIL> the guns <UNKNOWN> you know the availability being more people having guns that don't know don't <SIL> shouldn't have them <SIL> apparently <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> you know they should be uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-loc=lock> under lock and key <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and as for the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know the parents <VOCNOISE> somebody's responsible for you know <SIL> but see then you get in to catch twenty two because of the legislation i mean you can't require <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't see how you can require a <LAUGH> <SIL> uh <SIL> a guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe for the <SIL> for the gun and and and do all that stuff because that <VOCNOISE> in the case of a burglar comes into your house <SIL> which is why <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> why you have a <VOCNOISE> gun anyway you have some fear of something like that happening otherwise you shouldn't have one unless you're a sportsman <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> then you know you're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not gonna be worth it to have the gun in the first place so <IVER>
uh <SIL> i do believe that in some the cases <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> the parents or the uh <SIL> responsible adult <SIL> should be uh <SIL> found guilty of that <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
um <LAUGH-hum> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <EXT-I> well <NOISE> that's a <VOCNOISE> that's a tough one uh <SIL> i remember when you know when we were we had you know <SIL> some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know or <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was <VOCNOISE> you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but <VOCNOISE> and to me that's fake <SIL> and uh uh <NOISE> and i never really thought about when was growing up that it was <VOCNOISE> what was real and everything uh i always knew that <VOCNOISE> by i there again know by my dad being a hunter and everything you know i knew that when you shot something that it died it wasn't a it wasn't a game you know <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> i'd hate to think that that would <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> cause some kid to go off his rocker and shoot somebody out <ERROR-shi=shoot> shoot another human being i mean that doesn't <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> i don't even know why there should be any concern for it guess is what i'm saying <IVER>
<SIL> no <CUTOFF-we=we> <VOCNOISE> we uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i generally tried to keep her childhood her childhood yknow <SIL> there's a time to grow up and there's time to be a child and and uh <VOCNOISE> we divorced when she was eight years old so <VOCNOISE> i would get up every saturday morning and watch cartoons with her and stuff like that yknow <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> tried not to let her watch some of the ones that i <SIL> that i didn't like yknow so <SIL> and then on movies and stuff uh <SIL> we'd let her see some <SIL> shoot them up movies and everything but <VOCNOISE> the the weirdest movie she's seen uh <VOCNOISE> was e t <SIL> i remember that i mean <SIL>
