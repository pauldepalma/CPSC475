hm <IVER>
it's medicare type thing <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
and as <VOCNOISE> more and more people are getting older and older there be more <SIL> need for it <LAUGH> it be a lot of things there's gonna be more need for as people get older <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
tests <SIL> uh yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> well and i think chiropractors will be <VOCNOISE> more popular for the same type of reason <SIL> yeah <SIL> huh <IVER>
i uh i've gone to one but i had a back problem that's how <UNKNOWN> dealt with it <VOCNOISE> and it worked <IVER>
the same thing yknow i think they're terrific <VOCNOISE> for the right things <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
oh okay <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh you don't ask an easy one do you <LAUGH> that's a that's really <IVER>
yeah that's i mean that's really a tough one <VOCNOISE> uh because it's <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and yknow i don't think it's violence on tv <VOCNOISE> i don't think it's working parents i think <EXT-it's> <SIL> and i don't know what it is <VOCNOISE> it seems to be something more pervasive than <SIL> could be solved easily <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <SIL> <HES-I> i don't know it's a tough one and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> i mean your daughter <SIL> uh you said <SIL> daughter's yeah <VOCNOISE> is still young so you have to deal with but is scary <VOCNOISE> you send your kid to school and you hear these things and it's just <VOCNOISE> no matter where it is in the country or the world <VOCNOISE> you hear of it yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> really worries you <IVER>
<HES-well> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm very <SIL> much in favor of gun <VOCNOISE> control very strong gun control <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <UNKNOWN> i it they just seem to be too available <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <SIL> but then some of the things that the schools are doing about it <SIL> know the kid who comes to school with a paper gun gets <SIL> suspended that's <SIL> a little much but <IVER>
i don't know i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper <VOCNOISE> he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out <IVER>
and was threatening kids with it <SIL> and so they suspended him <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> it's it to me that's sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you've done it what the kid did and you don't want him to do it again and let it go <VOCNOISE> they suspended him i don't know <VOCNOISE> course <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um i probably say this <VOCNOISE> i got this version of the story from the columbus dispatch so it's probably not the whole story <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> it it is <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> and if you want something local that's all you <UNKNOWN> got <VOCNOISE> i mean there's one paper <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't even read it much <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> it's very conservative very republican <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
then there's <VOCNOISE> probably columbus it's <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> it's the democrat <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah franklin county usually votes differently than the rest of <VOCNOISE> at least the metropolitan areas of the state <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh okay <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well and it's not just in the schools it's in society <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> i mean violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things <VOCNOISE> and i <EXT-it's> <SIL> i i just <SIL> can't <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it's> it's hard to imagine that the <SIL> there's an easy fix if there is a fix i <VOCNOISE> it's kinda frustrating because <VOCNOISE> you can't point to one thing and say this is what needs to be fixed <VOCNOISE> yknow it's pervasive <SIL> <HES-uh> it's like the <NOISE> i don't know if you've heard about this in the news a woman <SIL> two of them were having an argument and one of <VOCNOISE> one of them set fire to the other one <IVER>
it was real close to my home <LAUGH> <IVER>
it's the grocery we <LAUGH-use> <LAUGH> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no i haven't been over there since then <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> but it's like <VOCNOISE> i mean you <SIL> there's these stories almost everyday you hear them <SIL> and that's <SIL> i mean that's even a big change from five or ten years ago <IVER>
or maybe it's <SIL> well <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> or maybe it's crime that's going down in the sense that it's supplying <VOCNOISE> yknow it's <VOCNOISE> criminals aren't as active but there's more and more of these <SIL> acts of violence <VOCNOISE> maybe it's because they're so dramatic <SIL> that you notice it <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah i mean maybe break ins are down <LAUGH> <SIL> or holding up seven elevens are down but <SIL> then you hear these yknow <SIL> murders <IVER>
and then they seem like random or just spontaneous <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's no way <CUTOFF-wa=?> nothing you can do in life to really avoid it except <EXT-hide> <VOCNOISE> hide in your basement or something <SIL> and that's <UNKNOWN> yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and that's not a life <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> and you <CUTOFF-n=?> got it walking down the street <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-uth=?> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there seems to be an awful lot of <SIL> publicizing some of it i mean some of it's pretty dramatic a woman setting fire to somebody what happened in columbine <SIL> it's very dramatic but <VOCNOISE> when it happened in columbine it was <SIL> all that was on the <EXT-news> <SIL> for a whole <SIL> day <CUTOFF-i=it> <CUTOFF-see=seemed> seemed like you <SIL> anywhere you looked <VOCNOISE> that's where it <NOISE-was_this> thing <NOISE-is> <SIL> <NOISE-coming> loose a little <SIL> there <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and that's <SIL> all you could see and it was like <SIL> well how much do <EXT-you> <SIL> how much new is there to say from minute to minute on every channel <VOCNOISE> how much do people really need to keep hearing it <IVER>
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lotta places they pick something that's sensational <HES-and> <SIL> keep <CUTOFF-m=?> <SIL> they're making it <SIL> even more sensational like <SIL> when <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> john kennedy died <IVER>
fortunately we were out <SIL> we <VOCNOISE> weren't <SIL> in the country so <SIL> we didn't know so <SIL> we had <SIL> heard just <IVER>
well we were uh <VOCNOISE> we weren't that far we were in vancouver so it's not that far away <VOCNOISE> we didn't hear about it for a couple days but i heard that that's <SIL> all that <SIL> was on <VOCNOISE> every aspect of his life every aspect of the search <VOCNOISE> did people really need to know that <SIL> do they need to have it driven <EXT-home> <VOCNOISE> and i think in <CUTOFF-ih=?> and i think at that point that's where the media are just <SIL> they're sensationalizing it <HES-and> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <SIL> everyday <VOCNOISE> <EXT-everyday> <VOCNOISE> there was something <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> it's like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i felt felt like i knew more about clinton's sex life than i knew about my own <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow_it's_about_the> <LAUGH> and it was far more then i wanted to know about anybody else's <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> where as yknow in the past there's been presidents who had affair the press never even acknowledged it even if they knew it <SIL> i mean at least that's what <SIL> ya
