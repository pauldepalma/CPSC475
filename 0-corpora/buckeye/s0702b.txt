<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> yknow it <VOCNOISE> because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i'm sure <SIL> i'm sure that i didn't pay more than three thousand on it <SIL> and <SIL> it <SIL> yknow it didn't cost me more than three thousand and so <VOCNOISE> if i had five or six thousand dollars out of it i was happy <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE-sure> <CUTOFF-ah=I> i mean that's <VOCNOISE> that's a lot of money for having a good <VOCNOISE-time> yknow <IVER>
so i almost bought one <VOCNOISE> um uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-bla=about> couple weeks ago <VOCNOISE> in fact i went <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i went into contract on it with this guy <VOCNOISE> this dear old man whose it was for his mother who was in her nineties in a retirement home was on royal forest <SIL> which is north <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i made this <SIL> this low offer and i never thought that they would <SIL> i didn't want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i <SIL> if i was gonna get this house i should get it <VOCNOISE> but i didn't really want now because of the baby coming and we're gonna be busy and i didn't wanna get involved in <VOCNOISE> and so i made this offer and then he <VOCNOISE-countered> back yknow i offered him ninety <EXT-two> <VOCNOISE> and he was asking ninety nine nine <VOCNOISE> so he countered back at ninety six and i said that <SIL> and yknow i thought well good now i don't worry about he's never gonna come to it <VOCNOISE> so i wrote back and said yknow <VOCNOISE> i appreciate your offer but <VOCNOISE> ninety two <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was <SIL> really the only thing i could <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> i could do <VOCNOISE> and i didn't even give him a time to respond because i just just assumed i was just <NOISE> <SIL> bowing out of it <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> checked my fax machine the next day it says <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my mother has decided accept your offer and i thought <VOCNOISE> shit i don't <LAUGH-this_one> what am i gonna do now so <VOCNOISE> i ended up talking him and i <VOCNOISE> i just explained to him that <VOCNOISE> um he'd caught me off guard and that i had more time to reconsider it <SIL> and that because of <SIL> and it's true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said that that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was <SIL> just <SIL> not gonna work <SIL> for me <VOCNOISE> he's a nice man i <SIL> felt bad <SIL> and so then i gave him <VOCNOISE-some> ideas about how he could sell it <IVER>
to help him <SIL> <IVER>
well i always assume you'd be running it that whole time <IVER>
i mean i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
see <VOCNOISE> the thing is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ideally <SIL> i would rather if i were gonna buy house in clintonville to hold them and rent them <VOCNOISE> my problem is <SIL> i don't have any money so <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> that down <VOCNOISE-payment> <SIL> has to be ten percent down <SIL> and so that means that i would have that tied up <SIL> while it was being rented <VOCNOISE> like we bought a couple condos over on bethel road <VOCNOISE> it's for my kids to live in so that my oldest girl when she's getting ready to move out she's like <SIL> twenty four <VOCNOISE> and <CUTOFF-sh=she> they couldn't find any place to live that i thought was <VOCNOISE> that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-so> i finally decided well <VOCNOISE> we'll find something and i'll buy and i'll be your land lady and then what'll it'll be nice <SIL> and so <VOCNOISE> i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to <VOCNOISE> was thinking she was gonna move out when she graduated from high school <VOCNOISE> and changed her mind so i just rented that one but it the bottom line is <SIL> i <SIL> i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work <SIL> with that helped me <VOCNOISE> buy those without any money <VOCNOISE> i didn't have a down payment i had nothing <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> so it's like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent <SIL> just makes the payment <VOCNOISE> but the other you would <SIL> you would be fine you be renting it you wouldn't buy anything that you didn't think you could rent <SIL> and come out even with <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> it's gotta be hard if you haven't <VOCNOISE> had other projects <IVER>

<VOCNOISE-and> it was it was fun <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i met a lot of neat <VOCNOISE-people> <VOCNOISE> in fact that's where i met the woman whose child i took care of she was one the artists who came to me <VOCNOISE> <Hes-and> <VOCNOISE> it but it was not <VOCNOISE> nobody was gonna make any money on it <SIL> and it was the kind of thing that <VOCNOISE> it was a project i started it when my youngest daughter started kindergarten because i needed a new project <VOCNOISE> and i didn't know <VOCNOISE> anything about it <SIL> i'd never even been in a gallery <VOCNOISE> i thought <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> this'll be fun <VOCNOISE> i'll just rent this space because i found this space and i was trying think of something i could do with it <VOCNOISE> so i thought well i'll rent this space <VOCNOISE> <EXT-and> then ah <SIL> i know what i'll do <SIL> i'll just put an ad in the paper and i'll find a bunch of artists and then i'll set this business up <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> and it was consignment so i didn't needed that money i just needed rent <SIL> and we had art classes and that was fun <VOCNOISE> and so <SIL> once i got that whole thing all set up and all ready to go <VOCNOISE> it's not nearly as interesting once yknow you <SIL> i like i like to make it <EXT-happen> <VOCNOISE> i'm not really <VOCNOISE> interested in just sitting there day after day waiting for somebody to come <EXT-in> and so <SIL> when the lease was up on high street i was gonna get rid of it <VOCNOISE> and a couple people came to me that were artists there and said <VOCNOISE> could we <VOCNOISE-please> yknow would you consider having some partners <VOCNOISE> and i said sure if you guys are willing to come and sit in this place and i don't come sit here so we moved to grandview <VOCNOISE> and it was doing <UNKNOWN> <SIL> much better over there <SIL> <EXT-and> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> then the <VOCNOISE-same_thing> happened <VOCNOISE> <EXT-the> attorneys who were next door to us decided they wanted our space and when our lease <SIL> was up <SIL> they had more money than we did so <VOCNOISE> we were gonna have to move <EXT-again> and i just said <SIL> this is not worth it <SIL> and <VOCNOISE-besides> that i was ready that was about <VOCNOISE> three four years into it <VOCNOISE> i was ready to do <VOCNOISE-something> else <SIL> and i had already started taking care of jesse then so <VOCNOISE> i used to take him down to the gallery with me and i had a little bassinet in the <EXT-back> and <VOCNOISE> people <VOCNOISE-say_is_that> a baby <LAUGH> <IVER>
