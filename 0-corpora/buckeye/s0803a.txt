<VOCNOISE> it's weird i i wish they would make it <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna say <CUTOFF-fr=free> well i think they do make it free <VOCNOISE> um and i hate to say it but a little bit easier access <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> i don't think it'll cause people to have more sex i think they're gonna have it anyhow <VOCNOISE> so it would only be better <VOCNOISE> and safer for them <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
the shot <IVER>
okay <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
okay <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> we <CUTOFF-w=were> my husband and i were just talking about this <VOCNOISE> i was saying i'm not in for the <VOCNOISE> yknow george orwell nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> my ideal situation would be <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> somebody decides who should have kids and who's not but i don't think god's gonna come down and do that <SIL> <LAUGH-so_well_yknow_what_I_mean> <SIL> we can't really decide that <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to be honest <VOCNOISE> i'm for it <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it doesn't have to be well i'm not even sure tubes tied is <VOCNOISE> is pretty <SIL> permanent <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <SIL> even if they could do something like on a yearly basis <VOCNOISE> and give them two hundred dollars a year <VOCNOISE> that's still not still much cheaper than them having kids <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and then if they <CUTOFF-w=would?> <SIL> i'd give more money if they'd clean up their act <VOCNOISE> just for them <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> as far as it being racist i don't think i think they're missing the <CUTOFF-p=point> <SIL> the point <VOCNOISE> because i'm sure there's some runaway white <SIL> teenage girls out there too <VOCNOISE> or mexican or what not <SIL> um <IVER>
think the point is they're on drugs yknow and i don't <SIL> yeah <SIL> i'm not <SIL> i don't consider myself racist at all <SIL> it is <LAUGH-unfortunate> that that's what's happening but <VOCNOISE> it's just one of those things that you hate to say yeah i'm for it because you sound like <VOCNOISE> it's like <SIL> everything is specific <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> permanent <VOCNOISE> yeah i kind of have a problem with that <SIL> um because they might change their mind <VOCNOISE> but then again they can always adopt <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> i kind of look at it that way there's enough kids out there that <SIL> need love and <IVER>
you don't <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> which cracks me up because if you've ever looked at the parents of models they're not necessarily all that <LAUGH-attractive> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <EXT-that's> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i know <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i do too <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> um <SIL> not to sound like a broken record but i really think it's <SIL> our uh <VOCNOISE> backslide on <VOCNOISE> on family units <VOCNOISE> i think it's too easy to stay <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> and i've been married and divorced so i've <VOCNOISE> unfortunately had that experience to me <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> it's too easy to get divorced <VOCNOISE> um people don't really go into marriage with commitment <SIL> and lifetime <VOCNOISE> and have that <SIL> i don't wanna say old fashioned values but just the value of this is very important <VOCNOISE> um because lets face it <VOCNOISE> to <SIL> to me love is a choice <VOCNOISE> because there's times when i don't love my husband i wanna smack him and he's being a little barney <VOCNOISE> but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes <VOCNOISE> and lo and behold an hour later week later what <CUTOFF-ha=happens> <LAUGH-whatever_long_it> takes <VOCNOISE> i'm in love with him again <VOCNOISE> i mean really <VOCNOISE> yknow what i'm saying <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> i think it's just too easy to get divorced <VOCNOISE> i don't believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of a just children <VOCNOISE> but i think if you really make that commitment and <VOCNOISE> actually work on it <VOCNOISE> you can have a great relationship you can <CUTOFF-h=have> have kids <VOCNOISE> and bring them up in <SIL> a more stable environment <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> unfortunately i think that's <VOCNOISE> the problem <VOCNOISE> parents <VOCNOISE> um are <SIL> a either getting divorced <VOCNOISE> and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other <VOCNOISE> yknow using the kid as a medium <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> they're too selfish and don't listen to their kids or they didn't <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna say selfish but lets face it like we said yknow even having a dog takes some time out of your <CUTOFF-s=schedule> <SIL> your <CUTOFF-s=schedule> <VOCNOISE> your schedule <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> not spend enough time with the kids <VOCNOISE> yknow they're working what not <SIL> and it takes a lot of effort <VOCNOISE> to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them <VOCNOISE> and let them grow and things like that <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and i don't think <SIL> enough <SIL> families are doing that <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i think <CUTOFF-ih=?> <SIL> uh some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely <VOCNOISE> um you do go through a period in your life <SIL> where <VOCNOISE> you don't feel like you have any friends or <VOCNOISE> you feel totally different <VOCNOISE> i mean i <LAUGH-still_go> through that i think we all go through that at some point or other <VOCNOISE> even yearly for some of us <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i'm just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody <VOCNOISE> either in his family <VOCNOISE> i say he <CUTOFF-k='cause(because)?> using those for example <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> the parents paid a little bit more attention and didn't have that blind eye <VOCNOISE> i think that's part of your responsibility as a parent that <VOCNOISE> if you see something potentially evil or wrongdoing in your <VOCNOISE> child's eyes <VOCNOISE> you need to really admit it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i mean you don't wanna do that <SIL> but <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
and his mom even signed for stuff i think <IVER>
yeah i mean yknow <LAUGH> signing <VOCNOISE> oh here you go hun <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> the one <VOCNOISE> i think is pretty obvious <SIL> that <SIL> the blind eye was something that shouldn't have happened <VOCNOISE> the other one <VOCNOISE> that yeah <SIL> you just <VOCNOISE> let's face it at that age and at every age we want a leader <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i guess it goes back if we choose <VOCNOISE> to <CUTOFFo-=or> or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we'll make better decisions of who's gonna lead us <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i don't know i <CUTOFF-r=really?> <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-b=??> i think a lot of it's the family unit breaking down <VOCNOISE> in general <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> and secondly i think to be honest i think the media's gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and i do think <CUTOFF-o=?> <VOCNOISE> yknow they know they're gonna get recognized they're gonna have their name go down in history <VOCNOISE> unfortunately <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think that has something to do with it too <VOCNOISE> um it's frustrating to turn on the news they don't really cover <VOCNOISE> my husband comes from a journalistic background and he'll be like <LAUGH> that's not news <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean it's just <SIL> we get so ah <SIL> let's sit here and watch a plane crash for twelve hours <VOCNOISE> instead of watching <VOCNOISE> i don't know what <LAUGH> little house on the prairie <LAUGH-I_don't_know_but> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-I'm_being_facetious_but_yknow_what_I_mean> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <SIL> and just going over it and over it and over it <IVER>
then you get the shooting out in honolulu and the next day there's another one <VOCNOISE> it's just kind of like <VOCNOISE> that syndrome yknow well at least i can be popular for fifteen minutes or whatever <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i mean i'm not saying not to cover it <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> and then course you have the whole gun control stuff that's just <VOCNOISE> ridiculous <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i think they might have tried any how but obviously they wouldn't have been as <SIL> uh <SIL> good at it <SIL> or <SIL> yknow what i'm trying to say it wouldn't have <CUTOFF-b=been> been as much distraction <SIL> because obviously the bombs <SIL> is something but to <SIL> actually have that <SIL> right there <SIL> i mean have the access and what not i mean <SIL> i guess the grandparents had the house <SIL> locked <SIL> and they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew <CUTOFF-th=??> how to use them and <SIL> uh that scares me
