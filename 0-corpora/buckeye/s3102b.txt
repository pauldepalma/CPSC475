<SIL> in a heartbeat try and help them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but they don't i don't think they <SIL> make an effort to like <SIL> put out any <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
okay <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> art <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> drawing and painting is my major <SIL> and <SIL> i <SIL> i um <VOCNOISE> i like doing all sorts of different things they don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i haven't even had any painting classes yet <SIL> so it's kind of funny i'm like taking sculpture and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> drawing and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> next quarter i have a painting class <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum i've <HES-always> been into <SIL> art <SIL> in in high school i went to uh <SIL> art <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=school> <SIL> like uh <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i was <SIL> for fine arts <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> always <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> wanted to do art <VOCNOISE> because i can't do anything <LAUGH-el-else> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no it's <SIL> mostly <SIL> i'm i'm not good at <EXT-math> or i mean i could probably major in english or something like that but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not math <LAUGH> <SIL> <LAUGH-yeah> <SIL> it's is the talent <SIL> my husband's good at math so that's where i <LAUGH-go> <SIL> i'm grateful for <VOCNOISE-that> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> i did <SIL> <IVER>
well i never really <SIL> think i had <SIL> first of all i didn't have <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> motivation i don't think to put in the effort to do it but <SIL> i don't think i had very good advisors when i was first here <VOCNOISE> i didn't really understand the idea of <SIL> that <SIL> u v c was separate from <SIL> art college and <SIL> that you had to <SIL> apply and <SIL> i didn't really know i just like oh okay <IVER>
<NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i just <SIL> well but <VOCNOISE> i didn't understand as much as you <LAUGH-probably> <VOCNOISE> i just like <SIL> like <SIL> clueless as to what i needed to do to become an art major <VOCNOISE> and i'd go to my <SIL> advisor and they'd tell me what to take and it was the art <SIL> advisor but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i didn't really <SIL> think <SIL> i had to do anything special like i didn't <CUTOFF-kn=know> know about the portfolio review and all that stuff <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that was probably my own fault for not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> asking questions but <SIL> so it took me a while and and i just <SIL> kind of <UNKNOWN> <SIL> went to columbus state <SIL> and went on a mission then came back and <SIL> so i just got accepted into that college <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
it's the art school <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> year <IVER>
yeah <SIL> it's <SIL> it's a um <SIL> probably about four years left <SIL> i'm almost done with all my g e c's and everything like that so <SIL> that's about done <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> it's all <VOCNOISE> i've learned a lot it's been interesting <SIL> i've liked my classes <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <CUTOFF-ah=I> i have <SIL> um <SIL> i've <SIL> a have a <SIL> different <CUTOFF-op=options> <SIL> options i'm thinking i could either <EXT-be> an art teacher or have some kind of <VOCNOISE> um freelance type thing to <SIL> from my <EXT-home> <SIL> and <SIL> i <SIL> i really <SIL> want to just <SIL> um hurry up <CUTOFF-s=school?> <SIL> get done with school as fast as i can i <VOCNOISE> we really my husband and i really wanna have kids and so <VOCNOISE> we don't <VOCNOISE-wanna> <SIL> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we don't wanna wait very much longer <VOCNOISE> the some of the classes i'm taking are <SIL> <HES-probably> <SIL> um <SIL> kind of <SIL> dangerous though <SIL> like <SIL> the <SIL> fumes from the paints and stuff <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i can't <SIL> have to wait till those are over <SIL> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
stop yeah those are real chemicals <IVER>
yeah <SIL> you still have to <SIL> be careful and <SIL> yeah <IVER>
so you have how many kids <CUTOFF-us=just?> <IVER>
one <SIL> well that's good <SIL> that's <LAUGH-exciting> <IVER>
oh that's great <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
yeah i can't wait <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well actually he was i don't know if you've heard about <SIL> the <EXCLUDE-name> <EXT-academy> <SIL> deal <VOCNOISE> well he was one the teachers that <SIL> um <SIL> tried to start a union <SIL> and was <SIL> <LAUGH-fired> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well he's he's <SIL> yeah he taught math but they had a general curriculum was just like he taught <SIL> seventh grade <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he gave him math science <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> supposedly social studies <SIL> all the stuff that <SIL> i mean it was just <SIL> it was very poorly run <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to begin with so <SIL> we would go out and <SIL> try and find books for the kids i don't know if <VOCNOISE> you heard that they he hadn't bought them books and <VOCNOISE> so we had to buy them <LAUGH-and> <SIL> i mean they got reimbursed but <VOCNOISE> it was just ridiculous <VOCNOISE> so they were trying to <SIL> do anything they could and <SIL> just to keep their jobs and keep the school <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hum-um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah it's supposed to be an alternative <SIL> type <SIL> to the public schools <VOCNOISE> where they can <VOCNOISE> hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not <IVER>
gotten somewhere <EXT-else> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> right <SIL> education definitely <SIL> and it's military <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah uh he <CUTOFF-hi=his> <VOCNOISE> he and <VOCNOISE> three other people <SIL> well a lot of them had signed the union <SIL> they have to have almost everybody sign <SIL> for it <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> um he was one of the people that had really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> been <VOCNOISE> yes <SIL> and so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he fired him but not for that because <SIL> you can't do that it's illegal <VOCNOISE> so he <VOCNOISE> but he sent a form letter <SIL> with <VOCNOISE> everybody <CUTOFF-ever=everybody> it was exactly the same <SIL> to the three people that were fired <VOCNOISE> except for their names were changed <SIL> for the <SIL> these <VOCNOISE> like basically made up reasons <IVER>
i mean he's uh he's kind of in big trouble they <SIL> they're <VOCNOISE> wanting to pull the charter on him and everything <VOCNOISE> so that <CUTOFF-i=it?> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but he's gonna try and um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> keep the school open which is gonna be ridiculous <IVER>
um-hum <EXCLUDE-name> is his <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> it's just <SIL> it got out of <LAUGH-control> <IVER>
i guess so <VOCNOISE> i hope that they can keep the school somehow <VOCNOISE> for <SIL> the kids and <VOCNOISE> but it won't be him running it <LAUGH> <IVER>
well he's working part time at lazarus but really he doesn't have <LAUGH-anything> <VOCNOISE> so i'm working <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah he wants to teach he's <SIL> he likes football and he wants to <VOCNOISE> coach football but you have to teach to do that so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> he was <SIL> he <SIL> did some assistant coach <SIL> <EXT-work> <SIL> at uh <SIL> o s u <SIL> for o s u <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he really liked that <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh-huh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
except for last year no i'm just kidding <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i i like to watch football i like o s u i've never really gotten into anything else but now <VOCNOISE> he like he likes the um <SIL> denver and <SIL> so i'll watch that with him <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't really know much about it <LAUGH-so> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
yeah that was pretty <LAUGH-bad> <VOCNOISE> i think they <SIL> i don't know what happened <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh really <IVER>
oh you're kidding <IVER>
i do have some relatives that <SIL> are um step <SIL> my stepmom's relatives that are there <SIL> they're actually members of the mormon church <IVER>
so that's <SIL> i guess i do have some <LAUGH-family> <VOCNOISE> by marriage <VOCNOISE> but they live near bloomington <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah i guess they do i don't know what <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> <EXT-where> <SIL> where where it is or how many they have <IVER>
oh you do know <IVER>
