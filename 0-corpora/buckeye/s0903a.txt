white women <SIL> who had actually <SIL> had it <SIL> done <SIL> than <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> than <VOCNOISE> um hispanic or african american <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i don't know <SIL> at least <VOCNOISE> in that case <SIL> i mean before we were talking about the government <SIL> i mean at least in that case there still is a choice <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> there's money involved but it's <SIL> it's not <SIL> so much money that <SIL> it would <VOCNOISE> radically change your life <SIL> in a sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow it's not thousands of dollars if it was two hundred i believe <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and <SIL> that's <SIL> yknow i mean if <SIL> if that <VOCNOISE> amount of <SIL> money <SIL> is <SIL> going to sway you <VOCNOISE> in that direction <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> yknow there is the debate about ten years down the line but <CUTOFF-wha=what> <SIL> yknow is there going to be something that's going to make them change <VOCNOISE> yknow what is it yknow <VOCNOISE> what is it going to be and like how <VOCNOISE> how realistic <VOCNOISE> is it for yknow what percentage i mean i don't know anything about the sort of statistics of <VOCNOISE> people who do clean up their act or anything like that but <SIL> i mean i do think if there is that element of choice <SIL> it's a lot different than <VOCNOISE> yknow the government <VOCNOISE> saying okay this is your cut off limit but i mean the statistics they were <CUTOFF-gi=giving> giving on <SIL> um the average number of children that these women were having and <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> yknow the <SIL> average <SIL> number of children that were just <VOCNOISE> taken to the hospital and left there or <VOCNOISE> yknow just dropped off wherever and and the state these children were in and <VOCNOISE> their lifespan and everything else i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow there's the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the <VOCNOISE> the child's life yknow i mean i think <VOCNOISE> all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and <VOCNOISE> yknow the same <VOCNOISE> is in england yeah everyone saying <VOCNOISE> oh because they were talking about <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i mean again was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> somehow <VOCNOISE> sort of <NOISE> forcing these young girls to at least be on birth control <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> in whatever way and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> again that <VOCNOISE> everyone was up in arms but it's <VOCNOISE> sort of like <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> what is that child's quality of life gonna be when their mothers <SIL> just <SIL> yknow <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh yes definitely in england too <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>

um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
um i don't <VOCNOISE> i mean there definitely is that image of <SIL> yknow dallas and dynasty i think it's <VOCNOISE> it's worse <SIL> i think <SIL> for <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> image of the tourist like basically they think <VOCNOISE> anyone who can <VOCNOISE> afford to be over there <SIL> must be absolutely loaded <VOCNOISE> yknow and that was sort of another thing <VOCNOISE> when <VOCNOISE> yknow i went to <VOCNOISE> school there <VOCNOISE> is <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i had a scholarship <VOCNOISE> that's how i went there <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> i worked the whole time i was in highschool in college and all this kind of thing but it was just like <VOCNOISE> yeah people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore <VOCNOISE> you must have lots of extra money to throw around <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow they just <CUTOFF-jh=just> sort of don't grasp the fact that <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> you can have made sacrifices to be there <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i do think <VOCNOISE> also in films yknow i remember actually being in bristol and that film california <VOCNOISE> with brad pitt and juliette lewis and yknow they're in <VOCNOISE> the trailer and everything else and <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> their accent and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i remember <VOCNOISE> a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of lounge room watching this and they said like <VOCNOISE> oh <VOCNOISE> yknow something like is that what they talk like or is that what it's like in the south and i thought <LAUGH-oh_my_gosh> yknow <VOCNOISE> what an image to have of like <VOCNOISE> the south and <VOCNOISE> yknow i was just kind of shocked <VOCNOISE> at this <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i think that there <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> with <VOCNOISE> yknow people who are going to university there and things like that <VOCNOISE> there isn't necessarily that opinion maybe <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> in a certain sector like when all you've heard is <SIL> the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> most people <SIL> like me or whatever <SIL> they <SIL> well <SIL> i shouldn't say like <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> yknow people who have more education sort of <VOCNOISE> not even without having to really think about it but <VOCNOISE> yknow there isn't just that <SIL> blatant view i mean i think that it is <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> the consumption thing <SIL> like <SIL> i think a lot <SIL> more realize now <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> i think americans have this <SIL> just <SIL> reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> like <SIL> obviously when you give that a closer look <SIL> so many people are in debt i mean i think i just saw something else on the news that said <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> across the board <VOCNOISE> we don't even break even we're like <VOCNOISE> negative one or something <IVER>
right right <IVER>
right <IVER>
credit cards <IVER>
right <IVER>
exactly exactly <IVER>
absolutely <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
i know <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and that's actually a really interesting thing too because <VOCNOISE> especially coming back <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> moving all my stuff out of storage <VOCNOISE> i've just been on this yknow i'm getting rid of half of everything i own because over there it's <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so <VOCNOISE> loaded down especially when i've spent so much time just living out of a suitcase yknow i just really realize <VOCNOISE> i have so much stuff that i don't need because there yknow everyone has just sort of like <VOCNOISE> a little closet with clothes yknow there isn't stuff all around everything is more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it's like <VOCNOISE> everything is so <VOCNOISE> relatively inexpensive that it's like <VOCNOISE> yknow picture frames or something there might be yknow twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here <SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> yknow they're five dollars a piece lets buy five yknow <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> exactly <IVER>
um <SIL> well i think <VOCNOISE> the price has a lot to do with it <VOCNOISE> because <SIL> i mean that's what i see <SIL> see over there that prevents it <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> there a sort of middle of the line <VOCNOISE> dress that would be like at the limited here or something is <SIL> yknow <SIL> seventy five pounds <SIL> yknow at <SIL> like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that's a lot <SIL> yknow you see them in the limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> really if you buy that <SIL> you're not really gonna be <VOCNOISE> buying <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow more than one or like anything else for awhile and <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> i mean here there is that sort of like yknow <VOCNOISE> he who has the most wins or whatever that <VOCNOISE> yknow phrase is and <VOCNOISE> yknow there is that with <VOCNOISE> c d's and <VOCNOISE> whatever <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> i mean <SIL> even with the food and everything else <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> it's cheap people buy so much of it like portions <SIL> are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean there <SIL> yknow the portions are a lot smaller it's more expensive you just eat less and i mean <SIL> you just see it contributing to everything i mean <SIL> it the obesity problem here and everything else i mean <SIL> it's getting worse there than it was but i mean it's <SIL> nowhere is it any where near and that is <SIL> a large part of the like <VOCNOISE> problem with that <SIL> people were constantly on me about oh why are americans so fat and like <SIL> all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending
