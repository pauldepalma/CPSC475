um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so um <SIL> but yknow i <UNKNOWN> uh <SIL> yeah i think yknow a lot of times you think well yknow um <SIL> when you don't even know you sit there say i'm only a phone call away yknow <SIL> and all you do is call me but <SIL> it's not the same thing as <SIL> being there and <SIL> and she's <SIL> well i remember one time when she was having a stomach ache she was like <SIL> uh like twelve or thirteen years old yknow and <SIL> and i said well what's the matter she goes uh <VOCNOISE> my stomach hurts i said uh <SIL> well are you on you on your period or what yknow and she goes <VOCNOISE> dad <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<NOISE> <IVER>
so that uh yknow and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she would have been going to northland high school which is up here just awhile up where i'm living at one sixty one cleveland area <SIL> then uh <SIL> so <SIL> it would have been interesting <SIL> yknow <SIL> to <VOCNOISE> but then yknow that then the other side of it yknow the <UNKNOWN> the <SIL> they think <SIL> women tend to have the <CUTOFF-m=more> <SIL> more emotional <SIL> type of feelings than uh then men yknow we carry it on our shoulders yknow <SIL> so uh <SIL> yeah i just <SIL> hope she <SIL> adjusts <IVER>
