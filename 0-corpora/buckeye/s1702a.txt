it's better in terms <SIL> of the uh <VOCNOISE> city government <SIL> seems to the people seem to be more aware of what they're doing and it's not <VOCNOISE> oh well i'll just do this it's kind of like you know <VOCNOISE> there's some brains down there <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i'm a democrat and i've never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon <VOCNOISE> and i always <SIL> adored mark hatfield <LAUGH-I_didn't_vote_for_him_while_I_was_out_there> was the weirdest thing <VOCNOISE> because i thought he was a great <LAUGH-Republican> <LAUGH> <SIL> but i think uh personally mike coleman <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was good i <VOCNOISE> i've met uh well <LAUGH> we had a diamond jubilee at the village and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and coleman and teater both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i didn't think that <CUTOFF-bi=big> <VOCNOISE> there was much that much difference in them <ERROR-idalogically=ideologically> <VOCNOISE> i think yknow she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> in terms of having a black mayor i think that's good for columbus <SIL> i <CUTOFF-thi=think> <IVER>
i hope so yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
hm oh that's a real major <LAUGH-question_isn't_it> <VOCNOISE> uh hm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i don't think it's too bad <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> uh well we could go into the issue of uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the columbus board of education what's his name <VOCNOISE> he is always <IVER>
moss <LAUGH> <LAUGH-Bill_Moss> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-he's_always_saying> <VOCNOISE> oh this is <ERROR-rashist=racist> and that's <ERROR-rashist=racist> but i don't <VOCNOISE> think <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's too bad in columbus <VOCNOISE> i know there're places lots <ERROR-worths=worse> <VOCNOISE> like the south and so on <VOCNOISE> course <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh who who really knows <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the race issue is such a big question <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i like him personally and when he was running for uh mayor i would have voted for him i met him and everything but i guess he just is <VOCNOISE> plays the devil's <CUTOFF-a=advocate> advocate all the time at the uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the um school board meetings i i heard this is just a <CUTOFF-rum=rumor> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you want gossip in here <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-you> want some gossip <VOCNOISE> the gossip i heard was that um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> the superintendent of schools said that if <LAUGH-he_was_reelected_she_was_going_to_resign_and_so_they_gave_her_a_big_raise> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-so_he_she_must_be_a_thorn_in_her_side> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah he was he's gonna always be reelected he's got his <CUTOFF-gr=group> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i <SIL> uh his wife's a teacher and i understand an excellent teacher so i think he has real good information <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> that he works with <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well i think she maybe <CUTOFF-res=resigned> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> retired last year but she had <CUTOFF-a=?> <CUTOFF-uh=?> taught <VOCNOISE> columbus for twenty years or something like that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so i think his information is good <SIL> but i guess <LAUGH> <LAUGH-the> way <LAUGH-he> handles things sometimes gets <LAUGH-through-to-people> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> he always has <IVER>
whenever he <CUTOFF-run=runs> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well i thought he was gonna be elected uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> mayor too but he didn't there but i don't know what that was about but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> yknow he's got his <ERROR-constintuats=constituants> and their gonna reelect him because he stands up for the minority <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think he what he <VOCNOISE> <SIL> makes a mistake is saying labeling things racist that are not <CUTOFF-ne=necessarily> <SIL> necessarily racist but anyway <IVER>
um hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> maybe we're beyond that <SIL> we shouldn't <VOCNOISE> always be saying <LAUGH-that> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
well <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's i don't know <CUTOFF-wha=what> <CUTOFF-e=?> <CUTOFF-ih=?> <SIL> how to explain that <LAUGH-especially_if_anybody's_gonna_listen> to this <SIL> um <SIL> i had a friend that taught classes <SIL> human potential classes <SIL> was very interested <SIL> and participated very in depth in the human potential movement <SIL> so um uh <SIL> a a gentleman by the name of alexander everett <SIL> uh who <VOCNOISE> really is the father of the human potential movement <SIL> moved out there and he was gonna have <SIL> a group of people work out there and uh <SIL> and he said that <SIL> yknow i was qualified well when we got out there it just fell through <SIL> yknow and we all just lived our lives <VOCNOISE> but i was glad that <SIL> yknow that he got me out there <LAUGH-because_I_adored_it> <LAUGH> i <CUTOFF-d=just?> <SIL> i just loved it out there <IVER>
oh it's just so <CUTOFF-everyth=everything> the environment of course is <SIL> incredibly beautiful <SIL> um <SIL> and <SIL> everybody is more uh <SIL> i think <SIL> more open <SIL> or <SIL> more receptive to relationships <SIL> and um <SIL> yknow <SIL> i think it's a <CUTOFF-frie=friendly> much friendlier place and then uh i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just don't have poverty <SIL> well <SIL> if anybody's in poverty in oregon it's because they've chosen to live <SIL> a simple life it's not a <SIL> yknow because they can't get jobs and things like that although the <LAUGH-economy_in_Oregon> is not that great but yknow <VOCNOISE> they say in eugene <VOCNOISE> that even the dishwashers have p h d's they <LAUGH> well the the um <VOCNOISE> the level of <VOCNOISE> the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah they have a lot of <SIL> <CUTOFF-w=well?> <SIL> educated people who aren't out to just make a bunch of money so it <SIL> makes for an very intellectual <SIL> interesting <SIL> environment <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> people are trying to live simply there <SIL> and i kind of agree with that <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> well <SIL> i don't know <LAUGH> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh well <SIL> in oregon well <SIL> i was down in california for three months and uh <SIL> and uh i went to the <CUTOFF-v=vegetable?> <SIL> produce stand and i took my umbrella <SIL> and of course it doesn't rain too <LAUCH-much_in> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-California> <SIL> and i said <SIL> oh i'm from oregon and i always think it's gonna rain and he says well i'm from washington and i know <LAUGH-it's_gonna_rain> <IVER>
<LAUGH> but uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> well something's happening of course to the planet on uh <SIL> weather patterns and uh there been having droughts in oregon which is so strange <VOCNOISE> but when i was there it <SIL> it um <SIL> it rains from november through june it rains i mean <CUTOFF-tha=they> <CUTOFF-the=they> <CUTOFF-the=they> <CUTOFF-the=they> they say on the weather in the morning <SIL> showers changing to rain and then <LAUGH-the_next_day_they> say <LAUGH-rain_changing_to_showers> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-and_it_does_have> <VOCNOISE> but they don't use umbrellas i mean they just go through it they're just so used to it and they wear that kind of jacket yknow uh no <VOCNOISE> because it's not a hard rain <SIL> and the first year i was there it was pretty hard to get used to it but there's no cold real cold winter <SIL> and uh <SIL> and then from <SIL> july <SIL> august september and october's just gorgeous <SIL> just so gorgeous <VOCNOISE> but i like <SIL> i like that fog and that <SIL> mist and those evergreen <LAUGH-trees> <LAUGH> <IVER>
