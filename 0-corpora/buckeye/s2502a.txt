<VOCNOISE> if you don't make a child support payment <VOCNOISE> they should do the same thing i don't know why they don't have a system like that <IVER>
yeah i think that's <CUTOFF-probaba=probably> yknow i'm i'm not that familiar with it now but <VOCNOISE> i think that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that the people fall through <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah that's <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> yep <VOCNOISE> but uh fifty dollars a week <IVER>
yknow you can do anything for fifty dollars a week yknow you could work two two hours a day <VOCNOISE> yknow for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids <VOCNOISE> is really not that much a week so <IVER>
that'd be two hundred dollars a month <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah that was the most somebody could be <VOCNOISE> um ordered to pay <VOCNOISE> being unemployed <IVER>
and i think <CUTOFF yeah eighty four <IVER>
yeah so they adjusted that but then they didn't have any way to <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> enforce that so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i was gonna say i i've seen situations too where i can see their side of it <VOCNOISE> as well because <VOCNOISE> the mothers are used to or the wives are used to being home <SIL> and the husbands support them and in those situations they still want them to <VOCNOISE> they still don't want to go out there and do that and <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and <SIL> yknow they need to look at each one of those cases too <VOCNOISE> because i know there's alimony and all that kind of thing and <VOCNOISE> and that can be <VOCNOISE> detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and yknow <IVER>
and he does have a responsibility but i think there can be a line drawn <SIL> to how responsible he is and <VOCNOISE> how capable the other half would have been yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh yeah <NOISE> yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah well there's too many situations out there <SIL> to have everybody fit in to certain <NOISE> ones that just everyone of them's different <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
not really <SIL> no i was too proud <VOCNOISE> i would have never <VOCNOISE> i would have never <VOCNOISE> i think my dad paid my first month's rent <NOISE> for me though <VOCNOISE> i paid him back <VOCNOISE> and then i never i never wanted to borrow any money <VOCNOISE> i guess just growing up <SIL> the youngest of five <VOCNOISE> i appreciated <SIL> money <IVER>
and i didn't even want yknow and i knew <VOCNOISE> my mom is like if she can save a nickel somewhere yknow she will <VOCNOISE> so i knew that that's how they were and i didn't want to yknow it was my choice to get married it was my choice to have kids and <VOCNOISE> yknow i didn't i didn't feel <NOISE> the need to ask them <VOCNOISE> um well i think <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah they're ok they're parents they're in their seventies now <LAUGH> i <SIL> i take what i need and leave the rest because they've got their own opinions that are <VOCNOISE> a lot different than mine <SIL> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh my brother lives in connecticut <VOCNOISE> um and he's uh with a cement company <VOCNOISE> concrete <NOISE> i'm not even really sure i've never even seen him <SIL> <HES-and> where he lives <VOCNOISE> seen pictures and he comes and visits a lot but i've never <VOCNOISE> gone up there <VOCNOISE> um and his wife's an opera singer so she's real busy and <VOCNOISE> they they just are madly in love he got divorced after seventeen years of <SIL> marriage <VOCNOISE> and found the wife that he has now they've been married for probably almost <SIL> oh i don't know <VOCNOISE> seven eight years <VOCNOISE> and they're real happy <SIL> and his kids are grown and they have kids and <VOCNOISE> yeah the family is really pretty big the immediate family just us is thirty two <VOCNOISE> with our husband's wives and kids <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> so then i have another sister <HES-the> that was married to a doctor and just recently divorced <VOCNOISE> she's one of the ones that wants to <LAUGH=stay_home> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH=and_have> <LAUGH> it's unfair yknow life is unfair nothing ever works and <VOCNOISE> so um she's living in akron <SIL> in a house completely paid for by herself <NOISE> and <VOCNOISE> lives out in the middle of nowhere and complains how lonely she is <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> then i told her if it was me <VOCNOISE> completely alone i'd be in the middle of a city somewhere <SIL> yknow where you see people and <VOCNOISE> i don't know yknow it's just <SIL> you can always see what someone else <SIL> should do or could do whatever <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i she's always trying to recruit people to come and <LAUGH=visit_her> <VOCNOISE> but it's like a two hour drive <SIL> and then <SIL> everybody's busy yknow that's four hours of driving <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> i don't know it's just too hard to <SIL> keep everybody <SIL> in touch that way <VOCNOISE> but <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i have two other sisters <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> one of them is well it's funny because we're all divorced <SIL> out the five of us we're all on <VOCNOISE> one of them is on her third marriage and we're all on our second <VOCNOISE> except for one she's divorced and she hasn't remarried <VOCNOISE> and then my oldest that i told you in akron i guess she's not remarried <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> four girls <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> and then my other sister <VOCNOISE> just recently got divorced <SIL> um this year <SIL> or i guess it was um final end of last year <VOCNOISE> and she's got two kids <SIL> and raising them and <VOCNOISE> so they're all um most of them except for um linda and bobby <VOCNOISE> bobby's the one in <SIL> uh connecticut and linda's in akron <VOCNOISE> but everybody else is within ten minutes of each other <IVER>
ten fifteen minutes <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> yeah we stay pretty close see each other a lot <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah and i'm closer to the ones that that feel the same way i do about <LAUGH=things> <VOCNOISE> my oldest sister yknow <VOCNOISE> i can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i don't stay on very long with her <IVER>
oh its real negative she's real negative about things and <VOCNOISE> and tries to put me down for being positive or <VOCNOISE> yknow i always see a way out of something and she doesn't <SIL> and she i think she gets kind of mad <VOCNOISE> and plus she is feels like she's old at fifty and i said oh my gosh <VOCNOISE> you don't even have any bad habits i said <VOCNOISE> yknow you could live to be a hundred that's fifty more years <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean if you look at it that way <SIL> she's really <VOCNOISE> yknow fifty is not old <SIL> at all to me i mean that's just <VOCNOISE> you as much as you learn <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> you can't trade but <VOCNOISE> yeah my my one sister that's um <SIL> exactly seven years older than me <VOCNOISE> we're the closest <VOCNOISE> and then the sister that's two years older than me <VOCNOISE> she's the same way <SIL> she does a lot of things that i'm like why are you doing that yknow <VOCNOISE> don't <LAUGH=do_that> <VOCNOISE> so she's she pretty much stays <NOISE> low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes through but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah yeah we all get together <VOCNOISE> we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because uh <LAUGH=nobody's_house> is big enough <VOCNOISE> well and then we have so many little kids <VOCNOISE> that it's great because uh we just go to a shelter <VOCNOISE> inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and <VOCNOISE> they can run around the kids run around and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and then you can stay as long as you want you don't <SIL> yknow feel obligated <VOCNOISE> and everybody just brings in food <VOCNOISE> yknow everybody brings their own stuff and it's fun we've <VOCNOISE> yeah it is <VOCNOISE> from thanksgiving to christmas i mean it's just nonstop <SIL> family everywhere <VOCNOISE> so it's fun <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH> not me it's too <CUTOFF-expensi=expensive> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i contributed to too many people there's too many people there's not enough committment <VOCNOISE> it's too easy to get divorced <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> it uh the competition <SIL> i mean there's just tons and tons of <VOCNOISE> um just people <NOISE> everywhere and <VOCNOISE> young people today i don't <SIL> i yknow i don't know what the statistics are gonna be but <VOCNOISE> they <SIL> i don't think they have a good idea of what marriage even is <VOCNOISE> yknow before <VOCNOISE> and also before a marriage was a committment to <HES-a> a type of lifestyle <VOCNOISE> and that lifestyle's gone everybody's independent <VOCNOISE> everybody's going their own ways <VOCNOISE> and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that <VOCNOISE> is looking in the same direction you are and <VOCNOISE> is equally as independent <SIL> then <CUTOFF-the=then> might it might work <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> i yknow <VOCNOISE> and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual <VOCNOISE> situation <VOCNOISE> and uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <NOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i know i was really young when i met my husband i was fourteen <VOCNOISE> in high school so we kind of grew up together and <VOCNOISE> i didn't know anything else <VOCNOISE> and um just two complete different people <SIL> yknow different needs and <VOCNOISE> everything else so <IVER>
yeah well i didn't realize that until i had kids <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and i had two little girls <VOCNOISE> and i thought wait a minute yknow i my whole life changed because <VOCNOISE> my committment was to them and to <VOCNOISE> yknow get all the opportunities that were out there for them <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and it just didn't happen that yknow <SIL> well that we both had the same <VOCNOISE> he wanted everything to be the same <LAUGH> yknow <VOCNOISE> so i think that really changed everything <SIL> one could have <NOISE> it does you're whole focus changes because <SIL> everything you say somebody's listening and everything you want to do somebody's watching and
