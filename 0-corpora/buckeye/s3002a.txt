<IVER>
yeah it's a qualitative type <CUTOFF-ah=analysis> <SIL> analysis <IVER>
exactly <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah they're very quantitative as opposed to like the quality <VOCNOISE> and then so <VOCNOISE> the analysis is all about bottom line and the numbers because <VOCNOISE> actually that's why i don't like <VOCNOISE> like i like business and i <VOCNOISE> i enjoy my business classes but <VOCNOISE> some of the people in my business classes i can not stand because they honestly they're like <VOCNOISE> oh it doesn't matter how you treat people and then <VOCNOISE> it's all about the bottom line well <SIL> they'll <CUTOFF-en=end> <VOCNOISE> in my <VOCNOISE-opinion> they'll end up losing more because <SIL> it costs a lot to hire a new employee <VOCNOISE> and if you have constant turnover things like <EXT-that> <VOCNOISE> then <SIL> and if you have a product and <SIL> that <SIL> because obviously people aren't gonna <EXT-care> <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> so <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> and they they're they seem very closed-minded like <VOCNOISE> like this is the way business has to <EXT-be> <VOCNOISE> but the professors don't seem to <SIL> be necessarily like that <VOCNOISE> maybe i'm coming too far <SIL> going to one extreme <IVER>
but the professors seem more <CUTOFF-center=centered> <SIL> centered to me they're like <VOCNOISE> you have to balance it which i'm sure is the truth <VOCNOISE> yknow you can't <VOCNOISE> diminish all your bottom line <HES-for> <SIL> yknow making your workers <NOISE-feel> good but <SIL> there's still something to it i think <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-exactly> <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> see i'm not sure if universal health <SIL> health care would be <CUTOFF-th=the> <VOCNOISE> <HES-the> <SIL> the thing <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <SIL> i think it was <VOCNOISE> my freshman year <VOCNOISE> my sister and i went to <VOCNOISE> donna shale the <HES-uh> <IVER>
the <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> whitehouse like <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-person> on <VOCNOISE> she's <VOCNOISE-pretty> high up i guess i was <CUTOFF-un=unaware> unaware <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> she she had a talk and my sister and i attended and <SIL> i don't like the problem i think with universal healthcare would be <VOCNOISE> everyone don't you think like everyone with the littlest scratch would go in <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-a=as> <SIL> as opposed <HES-to> <VOCNOISE> like the very <CUTOFF-mu=?> <SIL> and <CUTOFF-ne=that> i think that could drive costs up <VOCNOISE> so there has to be a way to balance it i'm not sure how you would go about doing that <VOCNOISE> because you don't wanna <VOCNOISE-put> a limit and say okay you <VOCNOISE-can> only go three times a year <IVER>
because then yknow what if something major happens that fourth time then what <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE-think> <SIL> i at least for children especially because they have no <EXT-means> <SIL> to to help themselves <VOCNOISE> and like <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE-parents> <SIL> obviously <SIL> even if they're working a lot of times can't get healthcare for their children <VOCNOISE> so i think <SIL> at least for children <VOCNOISE> because how many accidents happen to children like <SIL> people are always <SIL> breaking arms and stuff <IVER>
yknow and <VOCNOISE> without health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars <VOCNOISE> and they have no means to help themselves at least if you <VOCNOISE> assuming you're eighteen <VOCNOISE> you <VOCNOISE-could> get a job like <SIL> and try and <SIL> <VOCNOISE-pay> for your health insurance i mean it i'm not saying it'd be easy but still <IVER>
it's more feasible than <VOCNOISE> a six year old <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> so i think maybe <VOCNOISE> not universal health care but <SIL> for children i think it'd be helpful <IVER>
yeah <CUTOFF-exac=exactly> medicaid i think <SIL> i think <SIL> it <CUTOFF-i=it's> <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> they're always synonymous but <IVER>
but they're uh <SIL> because they're both government programs but yeah <SIL> but i <VOCNOISE-think> <SIL> like i said for the <VOCNOISE> for the younger people because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it is <SIL> <CUTOFF-ay=?> because it's not their fault their parents can't get <SIL> <VOCNOISE-health> <SIL> health care <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh really <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh i see <SIL> well that'd be a good way i would think <IVER>
yeah yeah then <CUTOFF-the=there> <LAUGH-there'd_be_no> desire yeah <IVER>
yeah that seems good <NOISE> <IVER>
that's cool <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah that's uh <SIL> the the bureaucracy <SIL> it'd be too much of a struggle i think <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah but if you're the first state in the union to do it <VOCNOISE> it <CUTOFF-co=cost> it'll cost you <EXT-millions> and millions it would be rough it be so hard to <IVER>
<NOISE> i know exactly <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you would <VOCNOISE-think> but <VOCNOISE> i don't know there has to be something like <EXT-why> you know the first state <CUTOFF-tha=that> <CUTOFF-do=does> that does it <VOCNOISE> i mean <CUTOFF-aa=I> i after <CUTOFF-f=?> one i'm sure others would follow suit <VOCNOISE> it after they see the <VOCNOISE-benefits> of it <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> that first one <SIL> i don't <EXT-know> <IVER>
and it would take <CUTOFF-f=?> like years i would think to implement the programs successfully <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> government doesn't seem to work too swiftly <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-no_not_that> not that i've seen <SIL> yknow <IVER>
<EXT-no> because <VOCNOISE> honestly like <VOCNOISE> gore to me is like a <VOCNOISE-best> out of a bad bunch <LAUGH-like> <SIL> if i have to choose i'll choose gore <VOCNOISE> but that doesn't mean i necessarily like <VOCNOISE> he's most in line with a lot of my <CUTOFF-stu=stuff> <SIL> with a lot of my views <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-no=now> don't get me wrong i'm not <VOCNOISE> completely liberal on everything like there's <VOCNOISE> certain things i guess maybe <VOCNOISE> because going to school in ashland it just rubs off on you <LAUGH-there's_certain_things_like> <VOCNOISE> i'm not so liberal about but <VOCNOISE> i don't really <SIL> like gore just seems so dry and just not <VOCNOISE> it's hard to <SIL> i <VOCNOISE-think> it'd be hard to get people enthusiastic for him <IVER>
no not at all i would've rather voted for <EXT-McCain> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> over bush <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> bush <SIL> <HES-he> <SIL> he comes from a political family which i'm not saying is wrong because the kennedys were a big <SIL> political family <VOCNOISE> but i'm saying like bush is um <VOCNOISE> he just seems like <SIL> he didn't really <SIL> like <CUTOFF-ih=?> everything's been handed to him in life <SIL> <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> the issue of like whether he did drugs not that that's a big issue but i don't like the way he addressed it <VOCNOISE> yknow that to me <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-just> <VOCNOISE> if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake <VOCNOISE> but the way he's handling it saying i'm not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over <VOCNOISE> if he didn't do it he might as well just be like no i didn't do it <IVER>
yknow because then what does he have to hide <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> like the fact that he didn't know <SIL> like i <VOCNOISE-think> in international policy he'll be struggling if he becomes president <VOCNOISE> he didn't know the <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-three> leaders of the world <VOCNOISE> thing and then on top of it like <VOCNOISE> texas is a fairly big economy but still like <VOCNOISE> to manage an entire yknow <SIL> an entire economy <IVER>
i <CUTOFF-th=think?> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and that <SIL> like <SIL> i <VOCNOISE-don't_know> <CUTOFF-tha=that> that state's notorious for killing people i think they killed someone last night <IVER>
<EXT-so> <VOCNOISE> that to me is <LAUGH-very> <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> that's ridiculous like the governor he could've made a stay or yknow what i mean <VOCNOISE> and they've openly admitted that they've killed people <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> were found to be innocent later <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and it's like number one in the union and that's like <VOCNOISE> such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone's life and be like <VOCNOISE> oh our bad <VOCNOISE> that person was innocent <VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
<CUTOFF-tha=that> <IVER>
definitely <VOCNOISE> i definitely <VOCNOISE> the way i feel <SIL> the death <VOCNOISE-penalty's> wrong <VOCNOISE> but <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE-people> are always like oh you know if your mother <CUTOFF-ih=if> if your mother was killed god forbid <VOCNOISE> but like you would want the death penalty but <VOCNOISE> honestly i don't think i would <VOCNOISE> i really like i'd feel angry towards that person but <VOCNOISE> killing them doesn't <VOCNOISE> help <EXT-me> <SIL> with <HES-my> maybe the families say it helps with closure and everything but <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-eh=?> that to me <HES-is> <VOCNOISE> it's displacing my anger in a way that <SIL> actually i don't think <VOCNOISE> <HES-the> <VOCNOISE> my victim that i was so close to me would want me to do <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well like <VOCNOISE> i'm a philosophy minor <HES-so> <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> if you look at like different <SIL> ethical theories and stuff <HES-like> <SIL> <CUTOFF-yo=you> <SIL> like there's a hierarchy kind of <VOCNOISE> this is what i've found <SIL> there's a hierarchy of <VOCNOISE> things that are <SIL> uh <SIL> like the inalienable rights for instance <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> i can't <SIL> if you come into my house <VOCNOISE> and rob me <SIL> and then run outside <SIL> <EXT-I'm> <NOISE-not_gonna> i <CUTOFF-don=don't> <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> to kill you for stealing my property <SIL> like there's a hierarchy there <VOCNOISE> uh for stealing another life that's why people say oh you can do it so <VOCNOISE> but i really feel like <VOCNOISE> there's nothing <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> if i if it's inalienable the definition is <VOCNOISE> it's not <SIL> able to be taken not even by yourself that's why you can't commit suicide <VOCNOISE> and since it's the highest thing because without it you can't even do the others <VOCNOISE> it's so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because <VOCNOISE> without that you can't do the <VOCNOISE> you can't be <SIL> ethical in any other <EXT-way> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> that has to be the highest thing <SIL> and if it's <SIL> inalienable because <SIL> i didn't give it to you <SIL> i can't take it back <VOCNOISE> you never <SIL> forfeited that <SIL> you never gave me that right <VOCNOISE> <EXT-so> <VOCNOISE> that's why i feel like <VOCNOISE> i could <EXT-never> <SIL> want that in <CUTOFF-a=?> <SIL> to kill another person or <CUTOFF-an=anything> <IVER>
well yeah <CUTOFF-uh=under> <SIL> under certain <CUTOFF-c=circumstances> <IVER>
yeah well <CUTOFF-it=it's> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh we took <HES-um> <SIL> uh i took <HES-uh> <SIL> military ethics <VOCNOISE> as a philosophy course <VOCNOISE> and that was really interesting because even though in <SIL> even in that hierarchy <VOCNOISE> there's still certain contexts within the context of war for instance <VOCNOISE> if <SIL> if we both <EXT-know> if we knowingly go into it as combatants <SIL> and <CUTOFF-we'r=we're> <SIL> we're fighting for <SIL> whatever cause but if we both <VOCNOISE> are willingly going into it
