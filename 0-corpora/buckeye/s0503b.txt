<SIL> to diversity <VOCNOISE> and would <IVER>
would be <SIL> would be interested <SIL> in <SIL> i mean i mean <VOCNOISE> not just for the kids sake but but would be interested <VOCNOISE> on their own behalf <SIL> in in teaching the child what uh <IVER>
what his background really was <IVER>
right <IVER>
<CUTOFF-e=exactly> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
exactly but i do <VOCNOISE> there and there's the other side um <SIL> they <HES-uh> with <SIL> with native americans too <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> yknow yknow our children are being <NOISE-taken> away from us <SIL> well not exactly you're giving up your children and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-then> <VOCNOISE> something has to be done <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> but there's also <SIL> there's also that <SIL> uh <SIL> i <CUTOFF-m=mean> <SIL> i mean i think <SIL> that <SIL> it is probably a legitimate <SIL> fear that <SIL> children <CUTOFF-o=of> children of that group <SIL> are gonna <SIL> yknow <SIL> gonna be homogenized <VOCNOISE> out of <SIL> out of their heritage <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow they're <NOISE-kids> without parents <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
if you cared that much about about <SIL> keeping your keeping your own <VOCNOISE> well <LAUGH> there's the kids ready to be <LAUGH-adopted> <IVER>
um-hum is <IVER>
that's that's what i would <SIL> i would think in that <NOISE-case> i <ERROR-moon=mean> <SIL> i mean because the dominant culture <VOCNOISE> it i mean is always gonna be accessible to them <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah and <CUTOFF-every=everyone> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-to_you> yeah <SIL> yeah and and to a certain extent everybody gets the same upbringing <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-be=because?> <VOCNOISE> through <CUTOFF-thr=through> mass media <SIL> and and and <NOISE> <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> malls <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
is <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well i <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-wha=what> <SIL> what <SIL> what neighborhood do you live in <SIL> <NOISE-because> <VOCNOISE> i yknow i see asians and indians and <SIL> all <CUTOFF-kin=kinds> <SIL> everywhere but boy they don't live on my street <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> right yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um <SIL> <CUTOFF-ye=yeah> <VOCNOISE> people that live there i mean we've got the the yknow the indian department stores right down there on high street and <VOCNOISE> and a <SIL> couple of asian groceries <SIL> but <LAUGH-I_was> <LAUGH> yknow i <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know where they live <LAUGH> i <LAUGH-mean_it> it seems <CUTOFF-li=like> it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i don't <SIL> i don't know <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i don't know the people that i see <VOCNOISE> around <VOCNOISE> um <NOISE> yknow they're grownups <IVER>
really <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah um you're <CUTOFF-m=maybe?> you yeah you may be right <SIL> could be <SIL> could be <IVER>
i never thought of that <IVER>
an option <IVER>
i think so <SIL> i think so <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it's <SIL> it's so sad to see <SIL> a girl <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> have so many options closed off <SIL> now i don't mean it's by any <CUTOFF-s=stretch> <SIL> stretch that it's a tragedy <VOCNOISE> to have a baby but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> somebody in high school <SIL> is <SIL> is <SIL> making a lot of decisions she doesn't intend to make <IVER>
uh <SIL> and uh <SIL> <UNKNOWN> decisions are happening to her without her making them <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> i think she needs to have <SIL> as many <SIL> facts as she can get her hands on <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and i think <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> of <SIL> course we would all hope that abortion wouldn't be <SIL> that <CUTOFF-n=nobody> that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <SIL> i also think <VOCNOISE> uh yknow i <CUTOFF-me=mean> i mean <SIL> yeah there shouldn't be there shouldn't <CUTOFF-s=shouldn't> shouldn't spend six weeks on abortion <LAUGH-or> <SIL> six weeks on what to do if you're pregnant <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <SIL> but i think the subject has to be mentioned <SIL> just <SIL> just in passing in health class maybe and then and then <SIL> there ought to <CUTOFF-y=yknow> <SIL> it ought to be <SIL> it <CUTOFF-sh=should> <SIL> it should be known that you can go to your counselor <IVER>
and get some information <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah i'm <SIL> i'm opposed to parental <NOISE-consent> <NOISE> <NOISE-um> <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i don't have <NOISE-kids> so that's <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> opinion doesn't mean as <LAUGH-much_as_it_might> from someone who did <IVER>
well <SIL> yeah in a case like that <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=the> <SIL> the parents should <LAUGH-know> <SIL> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-because_there's_something_going_on> <IVER>
that shouldn't be <SIL> on the other hand i'd hate to see a thirteen year old <VOCNOISE> have a baby <SIL> because she was afraid <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well yeah <SIL> yeah i mean it happened a lot <SIL> and um <SIL> i've <SIL> had two abortions one <SIL> illegal and one legal and
