yeah <VOCNOISE> it's russia <SIL> in the ural mountains no not <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't even know <LAUGH-where> that is that's pretty terrible but <SIL> i don't think it is <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i think it is further east than <SIL> where i was i was right in the ural mountains so it's like the <SIL> border of europe and asia <IVER>
um-hum it was pretty <LAUGH-far_out> <VOCNOISE> the city actually had a million people <CUTOFF-in> that i lived in most of the time <VOCNOISE> but it was <VOCNOISE> the government that ran it actually was still <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> communist <SIL> <IVER>
they weren't they're not really <SIL> acting <SIL> they are the government there <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> they <CUTOFF-s=still?> <SIL> it's just all so messed up it doesn't really matter who's <IVER>
the <LAUGH-government> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> it's whoever wants to <LAUGH-be> <IVER>
um it was just <SIL> yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem <SIL> they just take over everything and they <SIL> they don't pay their workers and <VOCNOISE> most people aren't mafia so they <SIL> don't get paid <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah this was <CUTOFF-a=about> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> three years ago <VOCNOISE> about three years ago in august it'll be three <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> yeah it was <VOCNOISE> however many <VOCNOISE> was that in eighty nine or ninety or something like that <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> it gets more and more <SIL> um <SIL> like <CUTOFF-A=America> <SIL> it's not like america <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> more and more like a <CUTOFF-r=regular> <SIL> regular democracy every year <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> not really but <SIL> it's closer and closer <LAUGH> <SIL> a little bit <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it <CUTOFF-w=wasn't> <SIL> it wasn't easy <SIL> and <SIL> at first it was probably a lot harder <VOCNOISE> then after you've been there <SIL> for about six months and you start to just get used to things <SIL> but <SIL> i <SIL> i took for granted <SIL> coming to <CUTOFF-ameri=america> coming back here was <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it was so amazing to be <SIL> back in <LAUGH-America> <LAUGH> <IVER>
seeing all the <SIL> nice things just <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-e=everywhere> <SIL> <CUTOFF-e=everywhere> <SIL> everywhere it's just <SIL> i couldn't believe it <VOCNOISE> but now it's <HES-it's> easy to take it for granted again just <VOCNOISE> oh i'm back home <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well i was <SIL> with <SIL> um <SIL> i'm <SIL> <VOCNOISE> mormon so <VOCNOISE> we i don't know if you have ever seen how <SIL> they go two by two always and <VOCNOISE> i was with what we call another sister i was <SIL> and we would live in an apartment <SIL> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> would pay for our own mission and <VOCNOISE> there was a mission president <SIL> and they had different people <SIL> with responsibilities <SIL> leaders and <VOCNOISE> they would watch over you and make sure yknow call in the <SIL> every night and check on you but <SIL> it was really <VOCNOISE> up to us what we wanted to do we were <VOCNOISE> we'd get up <SIL> leave at nine thirty and <SIL> be home by <SIL> nine thirty or whenever it got dark <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> we could do <SIL> what we wanted <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i mean we had goals certain things that <SIL> like we <SIL> we had a set <SIL> where we'd like to do four hours of service every week <IVER>
we'd <SIL> like teach <VOCNOISE> english to little kids or <SIL> or help clean or <SIL> work at libraries or <SIL> different things <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh wow <IVER>
oh did you really <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
it might have been where the president lived <VOCNOISE> they sometimes have like a mission home <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
especially the guys <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
just <IVER>
yeah we had um <SIL> any <SIL> not really just <SIL> modest dresses you couldn't wear pants <VOCNOISE> and it <CUTOFF-wou=would> <VOCNOISE> dresses couldn't be ankle length <VOCNOISE> they couldn't be <SIL> um at the knee <SIL> had to be mid <CUTOFF-ca=calf> mid <CUTOFF-kn=knee> <SIL> mid <SIL> knee <SIL> or whatever that is calf <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> certain restrictions but yeah i mean basically just modest <NOISE> whatever <SIL> i mean i wear <SIL> boots with a dress in <LAUGH-Russia_but> <IVER>
i don't think you'd do that here <LAUGH> <IVER>
i think so yeah like their haircuts are a certain way and <VOCNOISE> can't <SIL> you have to shave and <VOCNOISE> um you always have to have your tie <SIL> and <SIL> your jacket if you can <SIL> unless it's really hot <SIL> there's <CUTOFF-di=different> it's different <SIL> also depending on the climate <IVER>
some places you're allowed to wear sandals <SIL> and <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-no> <LAUGH> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
just <CUTOFF-t=to> <SIL> i think it's uh <NOISE> a <CUTOFF-r=reflection> to reflect <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> the <SIL> uh um <SIL> beliefs <SIL> that <SIL> we're trying to <CUTOFF-sh=show> carry and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> i think if someone showed up and looking like <SIL> i mean i'm not saying that it's terrible it but if they had like a nose ring and all this stuff <VOCNOISE> then <SIL> it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> somebody might <SIL> <HES-not> <SIL> believe that they have anything credible to say <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> a lot of times if you're dressed <SIL> more respectfully that to <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i mean most the people will accept you <VOCNOISE> if you're dressed <VOCNOISE> in a dress <VOCNOISE> whereas <SIL> i mean even a person in a nose ring will <CUTOFF-ta=talk> <VOCNOISE> will respect you but <VOCNOISE> but then you're in a <VOCNOISE> you're at a <CUTOFF-l=loss> disadvantage if you don't <LAUGH> dress in a certain way <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right they look at <SIL> more what you have to say then <SIL> your clothes and that that was <CUTOFF-a> <SIL> something i remember them talking about too <VOCNOISE> you don't want them to look at what you're <UNKNOWN> <SIL> what you're wearing <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> that's mostly <VOCNOISE> that was a good <SIL> thing for the dress code just <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well not really they uh have a lot of <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> religious beliefs <SIL> on their own that they've had held on to because <VOCNOISE> um they have just have had nothing <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> they weren't even allowed to <CUTOFF-ha=have> believe in god <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> so a lot of them already believe and that <SIL> they have their own religion <VOCNOISE> and they <VOCNOISE> they're really faithful <VOCNOISE> so that was the <CUTOFF-m=main> one of the main problems is that they <SIL> um <SIL> they had been so <SIL> holding on to that for so <VOCNOISE> long and it's so strong <VOCNOISE> they don't wanna <SIL> let go of <VOCNOISE> what and then the men <SIL> their problem was usually that they would drink a lot <SIL> and <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> the it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was hard to talk to drunk people <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah they're russian orthodox <SIL> same <SIL> basically same thing <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i don't even know what their <SIL> holidays are <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i don't know <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
like <CUTOFF-Cathol=Catholic> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-Cathol=Catholicism> <SIL> oh from mormons <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> our basic <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> real fundamental belief is that <SIL> the church that the <SIL> russians believed in at one time was <SIL> the true church and that it was <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> the <SIL> the same church that christ set up <SIL> when he was on the earth <VOCNOISE> with the twelve apostles and <VOCNOISE> and but the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> after christ died that <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> authority <VOCNOISE> was taken from the earth <VOCNOISE> to <SIL> um have those <SIL> apostles and to <SIL> have the <SIL> the church set up like it was <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it <CUTOFF-w=was> <SIL> must have been really strong because it's still lasted all the same catholic and <CUTOFF-Ortho=Orthodox> all the orthodox churches still carry <UNKNOWN> all these beliefs <VOCNOISE>
