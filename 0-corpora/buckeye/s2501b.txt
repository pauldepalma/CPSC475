<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
uh it's all over they contract with dominion homes <SIL> and dominion is seems like it's going up everywhere and m i <SIL> so they're all over <VOCNOISE> uh they have projects all over <IVER>
uh it's not really an office he's like a um supervisor that just goes to the different job sites <SIL> he <CUTOFF-g=goes> he tells the the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and <VOCNOISE> and then he gets to um <SIL> talk with <HES-the> the other contractors <VOCNOISE> and he works together with them but he's really just <VOCNOISE> there's a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and they're all so different but he's he deals real well with people <SIL> so he's really <VOCNOISE> and he's even thinking of going into uh business <SIL> for himself <NOISE> yeah he almost <ERROR-doed=did> that this year and then he thought nah i don't want all the headaches <VOCNOISE> so he's like the top guy of <CUTOFF-wi=with?> of the people that he works for so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> it'd be good though because i could take care to the books and everything and <VOCNOISE> do all that kind of thing so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah we probably eventually will do that <VOCNOISE> but i'm like so up in the air about what i wanna do and there's <LAUGH-so> many things to do out there that <VOCNOISE> i need to take time to think about it <IVER>
so <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> no <VOCNOISE> i really don't i've done uh i've done a variety of uh <VOCNOISE> different <SIL> things and then also um <VOCNOISE> just reading <SIL> and and things uh since i've been off and <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-wante=wanted> i wanted to go back to school i thought about that and <SIL> i wanna do something with kids <VOCNOISE> i almost thought of opening my own daycare center <SIL> but then i didn't know if i wanted to get into that and <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> just trying to <VOCNOISE> take my time <SIL> do what i wanna do <SIL> yeah <IVER>
oh <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well and that's good for the baby <SIL> too <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
oh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> gosh i hate that's really going around a lot <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> let's see i got divorced when my oldest was three and my youngest was about six months almost a year <VOCNOISE> so i've <SIL> i've raised them basically myself <SIL> yeah so i did go back to work <IVER>
uh <HES-s=six> five years ago almost five years ago couple months <SIL> short of that <SIL> oh <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i um well and that was really um <SIL> struggle <SIL> yknow a struggle for money and everything so <VOCNOISE> i would take whatever would come along <SIL> and when you work in secure <SIL> jobs like that i mean you i had a different job <SIL> every year <VOCNOISE> i mean a year would come up and i'd say okay here we go <VOCNOISE> yknow they're either gonna downsize or they're gonna <VOCNOISE> do something and they always did so i was never really shocked <SIL> and i didn't panic or anything <HES-and> i was never without a job and never had to <VOCNOISE> i never missed um <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> i would say it would take <SIL> probably two weeks <SIL> at the most <SIL> before i would be working again <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> eighty four <NOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <SIL> yeah pretty good for secretarial administrative type work i mean everybody's always looking for that <IVER>
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and <VOCNOISE> yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of <VOCNOISE> different yeah i experience with <VOCNOISE> um sexual harassment <IVER>
yeah real bad and and it was <VOCNOISE> yknow mainly um <VOCNOISE> no one talked about it <IVER>
yknow i mean it was just like <VOCNOISE> and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else <VOCNOISE> so you would never wanna <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=say> yknow ever say anything <VOCNOISE> but um yeah that <CUTOFF-i=it?> <IVER>
well <IVER>
i walked out and uh it wasn't quietly <SIL> and i <LAUGH-walked> <LAUGH-out> <VOCNOISE> but it felt good <SIL> and uh <SIL> and i didn't even know if i was gonna be living in the streets <VOCNOISE> but i'll never forget the day yknow and his wife worked in the office too <VOCNOISE> so i went to her and i said it was nice working with you i'm going home yknow <VOCNOISE> can reach me at home <VOCNOISE> and then he was shocked and he just couldn't believe it and he said you can't do this <VOCNOISE> he says i won't pay you <VOCNOISE> and i said <CUTOFF-w=watch> <SIL> uh yknow watch me walk out the door and i don't want any money yknow <VOCNOISE> so i left out <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> oh it was just a <SIL> a long drawn out thing i mean it <CUTOFF-thi=this> started out with little things <VOCNOISE> and then it just got bigger like <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> he had an office <SIL> off of the main office and it was a pretty prominent uh insurance company <VOCNOISE> and he had his own um agency and he was a successful i mean he's probably still is out there very successful <VOCNOISE> but i was doing some computer training and he was walking me to the other side of the <VOCNOISE> building <VOCNOISE> and he locked the door <SIL> and turned around <VOCNOISE> he said why don't you get the <ERROR-first=front> or the front door <SIL> and it was only he and i in the office yknow and every once in a while his wife would be in there <VOCNOISE> and i just i lost it i was i uh <VOCNOISE> i was mad but i i didn't want him to think that i was afraid <VOCNOISE> i wanted to <VOCNOISE> be of him to be afraid of me <VOCNOISE> so i just <SIL> i stomped back to my desk <VOCNOISE> and i said oh <EXT-great> i said not only are you a pain to work with i have to be afraid of you <VOCNOISE> and then i think i did scare him because he start yknow he backed off a lot <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> just his personality and his his <VOCNOISE> and then that that was a real um <SIL> slap in the face for him <VOCNOISE> so he was really mean after that so i left i just i walked out <VOCNOISE> i picked the kids up at the bus stop and they're like mommy what are you doing <VOCNOISE> i said we're going somewhere <CUTOFF-ki=kids?> <CUTOFF-le=lets> get in the <LAUGH-car> <LAUGH> so <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> yeah just couple experiences like that though make you do other things so <VOCNOISE> yknow i stayed <SIL> tough and i <SIL> yknow got other jobs and <IVER>
was pretty good never had to borrow any money <VOCNOISE> never went on welfare <VOCNOISE> didn't <VOCNOISE> i think i was on food stamps or something for a month <IVER>
when i first <SIL> yknow <SIL> got a divorce <VOCNOISE> so it's been hard <IVER>
um uh <SIL> he was in so much trouble <SIL> and he was <VOCNOISE> that was the main reason why i didn't stay with him is he was just draining on me and <VOCNOISE> pulling me down so <VOCNOISE> he was never really there he was in and out of jail all the time <VOCNOISE> and i would go through the whole <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-chuh=child> <SIL> bureau child support <SIL> that whole thing and that was a <SIL> total mess <VOCNOISE> he'd have wasted all the time to go down there to court appearances and all this other stuff well <VOCNOISE> it turned out he could just move <IVER>
he found out he could just move <VOCNOISE> yeah so yknow he always got away from that <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i think they're really helpful and i think that it's the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there's really <VOCNOISE> but there's so much fraud <SIL> and there's so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it <VOCNOISE> yknow like with me i didn't wanna stay on it i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it <VOCNOISE> but if <SIL> i <CUTOFF-w=?> didn't have the ambition <VOCNOISE> that that i had i might have stayed home there's like nine yknow <VOCNOISE> there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that <VOCNOISE> i would get up and go to work every day <VOCNOISE> and she would have food delivered to the her front step <VOCNOISE> and she drove that year's <HES-car> <SIL> i mean she had a brand new <VOCNOISE> yknow like whatever year it was that's the car she had and i <VOCNOISE> i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and <VOCNOISE> yknow i thought <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah she probably got um <VOCNOISE> i don't know maybe even she sold drugs or yknow whatever kind of way she made her money <VOCNOISE> but it wouldn't have been enough <SIL> welfare wise to get a <SIL> car and to <IVER>
support the her <SIL> living conditions or whatever <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for long time which yknow i'm sure she did <VOCNOISE> i don't know i always thought <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i always thought it would be neat to have <SIL> a system like the police have <VOCNOISE> if you don't pay a speeding ticket there's a warrant for your arrest and they come after you <SIL>
