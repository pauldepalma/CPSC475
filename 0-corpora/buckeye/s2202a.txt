<IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i got some of the inside dope <VOCNOISE> on uh the area from him <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> they had <VOCNOISE> there's a <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether it been a large grainery or something that had a concrete floor <VOCNOISE> and some <VOCNOISE> industrious g i had <VOCNOISE> chipped a hole about <VOCNOISE> so big around in that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and dug out the dirt under it <IVER>
so that he got down in a <VOCNOISE> an area under that concrete floor <VOCNOISE> the concrete was about so deep which <IVER>
better than that much dirt <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-and_uh> <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> whenever they <VOCNOISE> we heard any <VOCNOISE> firing like it was coming toward us why <VOCNOISE> we'd <LAUGH> head for that hole <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh let's see <VOCNOISE> i've already told you more than i ever told anybody else i think <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <IVER>
at <CUTOFF-An=Anzio> at anzio you said oh <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
one of my kids got it for me <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-makes_our_generations> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-sound_like_heroes> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
well i don't think he <VOCNOISE> exaggerated but he uh <VOCNOISE> he was selective about the people that he <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he described in there <IVER>
which <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-was_the> <VOCNOISE> purpose of his book i suppose <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and of course bill mauldin was <VOCNOISE> the greatest <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_mean> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> you <CUTOFF-go=got?> have you seen his <VOCNOISE> cartoons and <VOCNOISE> uh haven't you <IVER>
well he <VOCNOISE> his two main <CUTOFF-car=cartoons> uh <VOCNOISE> main characters in his cartoons were willie and joe <IVER>
two <VOCNOISE> g i's <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> oh <LAUGH-they> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-they> <VOCNOISE> they saw the <VOCNOISE> the ragged end of the war <IVER>
according to that <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> i can't think what some of their observations were but <VOCNOISE> there's usually just one or two <VOCNOISE> lines of <IVER>
of dialogue under one of their <VOCNOISE> their cartoons and the cartoon told <VOCNOISE> most of it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-and> <LAUGH> there was one <VOCNOISE> where they were going along and <VOCNOISE> there's a little <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> scroungey looking dog about so long and about that high kind of following along after them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> joe <VOCNOISE> i'm glad that i finally <VOCNOISE> see somebody i can be sorry for that's worse <ERROR-ara??=off> worse off than i <LAUGH-am> <IVER>
what <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> under the conditions that had to prevail i was treated well enough <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it was uh <VOCNOISE> part of the time <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't feel like i've <VOCNOISE> <SIL> gained anything from it that i didn't deserve i mean <IVER>
in the way of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> benefits <IVER>
huh <IVER>
well that and <VOCNOISE> see uh <VOCNOISE> they had the g i bill of rights <IVER>
which was <VOCNOISE> a boon to <VOCNOISE> thousands and thousands of guys my age <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> when i started as an apprentice <VOCNOISE> in the shop they said well <VOCNOISE> we'll start you at a dollar an hour <VOCNOISE> well i thought that sounds pretty good yknow in nineteen forty five <VOCNOISE> in the fall of nineteen forty five <VOCNOISE> so then <VOCNOISE> as things worked out in washington d c <VOCNOISE> they came out with the g i bill of rights <VOCNOISE> we found out that uh that would apply to apprentices too <IVER>
and so uh <VOCNOISE> soon as my <VOCNOISE> shop found out that i could <VOCNOISE> draw that <VOCNOISE> whole <VOCNOISE> ninety dollars a month <IVER>
i mean whoo <VOCNOISE> they said well <VOCNOISE> since you're getting that <VOCNOISE> why we'll <VOCNOISE> cut <VOCNOISE> cut your pay back to what <VOCNOISE> you would <VOCNOISE> normally draw under the apprenticeship program <IVER>
which was fifty seven cents an hour <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> for a <VOCNOISE> to support a wife and a <ERROR-wall=small?> small baby on that was <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> kind of tough going <IVER>
well <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> i was <VOCNOISE> exposed to a lot of <VOCNOISE> men who were not <VOCNOISE> brought up with as i was <VOCNOISE> but there were a lot of them that were <IVER>
i mean uh <VOCNOISE> like uh <VOCNOISE> what's his name that who wrote the book you just <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i was <VOCNOISE> i think that he's <VOCNOISE> he's right that our <VOCNOISE> my generation <VOCNOISE> was <VOCNOISE> <EXT-more> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> oh <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> i want to don't want to say spiritual but more morally <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well directed than <VOCNOISE> at least a lot of the <CUTOFF-pe=people?> kids today <IVER>
i don't say that of all of the <NOISE-kids> because i know that <VOCNOISE> some of them <VOCNOISE> were <SIL> brought up right <IVER>
but uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> well i was <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i was pretty well <VOCNOISE> established about responsibility and <VOCNOISE> that sort of thing before i went into service <VOCNOISE> i was the oldest son in a family of ten <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> i had some <VOCNOISE> family responsibilities <VOCNOISE> we were <VOCNOISE> my brother and i and my sisters <VOCNOISE> were active in the four h clubs <IVER>
which was a <VOCNOISE> a going thing <IVER>
at that <NOISE-time> <VOCNOISE> in the uh <VOCNOISE> thirties <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> and did i say we <VOCNOISE> went to church <SIL> fairly regularly but <VOCNOISE> to tell you the truth i can't <VOCNOISE> remember too much that i <LAUGH-was> taught then <LAUGH-but> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but i was exposed to it anyway and i'm <VOCNOISE> i'm sure that some of it <VOCNOISE> rubbed off on me <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> uh my youngest son <VOCNOISE> married a catholic girl who was <VOCNOISE> from a large catholic family <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> their kids are going to a catholic school <IVER>
now i think that <VOCNOISE> those four kids at least among my grandchildren <VOCNOISE> are <VOCNOISE> getting pretty much at the same <VOCNOISE> training that i did or maybe better than i got <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> my oldest son's two daughters <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-are> <VOCNOISE> well they're good kids and they're smart kids <VOCNOISE> but i don't think that they have the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> moral grounding <VOCNOISE> that uh <VOCNOISE> greg and beth's kids do <VOCNOISE> you said this is all confidential <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and my <VOCNOISE> but now my daughter's <VOCNOISE> my daughter has twin sons <VOCNOISE> who just <VOCNOISE> are a year out of <VOCNOISE> college <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i think that they are <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-w=one> <NOISE> <CUTOFF-w=one> they <VOCNOISE> one of them particularly is <VOCNOISE> i think in <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> good moral <VOCNOISE> good sort of guy and <VOCNOISE> the other one <VOCNOISE> i don't feel like i know as well but <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i really think that they're <NOISE> both <VOCNOISE> good <NOISE> <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> see <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
i can't <IVER>
