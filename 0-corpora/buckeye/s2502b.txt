<VOCNOISE> yknow you have to be a good example <VOCNOISE> i mean if you <VOCNOISE> if you're just that for your <NOISE-kids> <NOISE> then <NOISE-that's> all they <NOISE-need> <VOCNOISE> yknow you might not always do the right things or say the right things but <VOCNOISE> if you're taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the <NOISE-right_things> then <VOCNOISE> think that's the best you can do for them <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> uh yeah i think it's real important to really good uh <SIL> get a good <SIL> <EXT-uh> feel for how you are and <VOCNOISE> all your beliefs and all that they have to really match <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and if they don't <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> then it's not ever going to work because because there's always gonna be <VOCNOISE> conflict and <VOCNOISE> friction and all that kind of thing so i think it's real important <VOCNOISE> and there's no age limit on that to when you really feel <NOISE_good> about yourself and you really know what you want to do <VOCNOISE> then that's the only time that you can really commit <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and say yeah we do have a mutual <VOCNOISE> thing <VOCNOISE> and young people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> their <SIL> yknow there's so many different infatuations to start with <VOCNOISE> that they get blinded and they get <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> off course and everything else and <VOCNOISE> and then it doesn't stay the same <VOCNOISE> i mean it's all exciting and <VOCNOISE> and all that <SIL> and then it yknow i think it's kind of <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah <VOCNOISE> i was never gonna get married again i had my house my kids yknow i had already done that <VOCNOISE> i was financially secure and i didn't <VOCNOISE> i wasn't even looking <VOCNOISE> one of my best friends though at the time <VOCNOISE> uh she saw this <SIL> guy she <CUTOFF-iy=he> he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing <VOCNOISE> and i talked to this girl <SIL> every day and she's like <SIL> oh you have to meet him you have to meet him <VOCNOISE> i was like oh yknow call me tomorrow i don't <LAUGH-want_to> meet anybody <VOCNOISE> so it took a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were <VOCNOISE> she was right <VOCNOISE> i mean uh we were like inseparable from <VOCNOISE> probably of two weeks <SIL> after we met <SIL> we just i've <VOCNOISE> haven't been without him <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>

right <IVER>
<NOISE-um> he doesn't seem <SIL> he doesn't seem to have any problem it's always been yknow what ever she <LAUGH=wants> i know <VOCNOISE> so far <SIL> it's worked out <SIL> pretty well so yknow i'm sure in a situation like that things are gonna come up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but we'll we'll deal with it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<EXT-no> <VOCNOISE> no <LAUGH-she_wa> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well she stayed um <SIL> she stayed with us <SIL> like for the first <NOISE-week> <VOCNOISE> and then she was done she was like ready to go <VOCNOISE> so and that was okay but <VOCNOISE> her apartment <VOCNOISE> lease was up <SIL> the <SIL> uh week <VOCNOISE> that she was in the hospital having the baby <VOCNOISE> so i had to move her <VOCNOISE> and uh my husband's family was visiting at the time <SIL> and so <VOCNOISE> his mom stayed she lives in florida <SIL> and she stayed with me <VOCNOISE> and helped me pack her whole apartment <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> get her in to her new apartment and <VOCNOISE> and that was just yknow <IVER>
well i know <LAUGH> and yknow when i think back about that week that was just crazy <SIL> because it was on a saturday morning she went into labor <SIL> so i was up <SIL> all night <SIL> saturday and <VOCNOISE> all day sunday i didn't get home till <SIL> sunday night <SIL> and then <SIL> <CUTOFF-hi=his> <SIL> oh his his brother from vancouver <VOCNOISE> his daughter from canada <SIL> and his <SIL> mom from florida <SIL> were staying with us <SIL> and they were leaving that tuesday <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah it was like <VOCNOISE> yeah uh <EXCLUDE-name> was <VOCNOISE> five weeks early <SIL> delivering <VOCNOISE> so it was really yknow unplanned as far as when we were expecting it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> you were past ready <LAUGH> <SIL> yeah <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh gosh <IVER>
oh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> when you think about the different generations and things we certainly didn't have the things to worry about <SIL> <NOISE-that_people_do_now> <VOCNOISE> who knows in elementary and junior high and <VOCNOISE> we would have never dreamed <VOCNOISE> of anybody having good <NOISE_gun> <NOISE> or even in let alone a knife <VOCNOISE> i mean that <VOCNOISE> and that's violence and that's that goes back to kids <VOCNOISE> and how much time and and effort you put in to them <VOCNOISE> yknow kids are ignored and pushed aside and they're in the way and there's so many people that <VOCNOISE> don't even want them and <VOCNOISE> yknow and then they get in to school and they get violent <SIL> and they they take it out <HES-uh> yknow and everybody's surprised <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i'm not because i know there's a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> and going to school <VOCNOISE> is getting to be so dangerous <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> because you have so many of them in one little room <VOCNOISE> and they're coming from so many different backgrounds <VOCNOISE> and if you take each one of their situations <VOCNOISE> i can bet the statistics as time goes on <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> they <CUTOFF-di=did> <VOCNOISE> they're not gonna have <VOCNOISE> one caring parent <SIL> yknow maybe not even one of the parents <SIL> yknow they might have a foster family or <VOCNOISE> yknow somebody that wants to pretend like they care yknow there's a lot of the people that <VOCNOISE> that are foster families that only want the money <SIL> yknow and <VOCNOISE> and there's <CUTOFF-th=that> all that so <SIL> it's <SIL> it's really scary and i think <SIL> i think that it had something has to be done real <NOISE-fast_I_don't_know_what> <VOCNOISE> i think it starts from <VOCNOISE> what we teach them <VOCNOISE> and as adults what we allow <SIL> to be out there <VOCNOISE> the computers <VOCNOISE> i mean oh my gosh <VOCNOISE> i didn't even get a computer because i was so afraid of what <VOCNOISE> they could be able to <VOCNOISE> access there was not <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> there was nothing barred at <VOCNOISE> all when they first came out <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> and yknow where are all those software people they're not responsible for <VOCNOISE> y two k they're not responsible for <VOCNOISE> yknow all this internet access to all the stuff <VOCNOISE> so it's really hard <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well when you have formulas to make bombs and yknow <IVER>
how to <VOCNOISE> uh step by step of how to commit suicide and <VOCNOISE> yeah they have to be responsible i think <VOCNOISE> because yknow you put an idea in to somebody's head and then <VOCNOISE> when you give them the resources to carry <NOISE-these> those things out <VOCNOISE> i think it's <VOCNOISE> it has to be <NOISE-responsible> for a lot of it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
but it <SIL> and it's <SIL> it's parents that fight for <SIL> the <NOISE-society> <VOCNOISE> and the what's in your community <VOCNOISE> yknow the parents for each individual child <VOCNOISE> they have to all form together as a group <VOCNOISE> and almost be <VOCNOISE> all parents to <VOCNOISE> all these kids <SIL> as a group <VOCNOISE> yknow it's not <VOCNOISE> you can be the best parent in the world at home <SIL> and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they <VOCNOISE> get in a group of kids where their <VOCNOISE> parents they don't even know where they are <SIL> yknow it's the kids responsibility to get <VOCNOISE> and go to school <VOCNOISE> yknow maybe the mom and dad didn't even come home the night before but <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean there's all different kinds of situations <VOCNOISE> so i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what <VOCNOISE> all the kids are being <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> shown and <SIL> and have access to <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah you really do <SIL> yeah
