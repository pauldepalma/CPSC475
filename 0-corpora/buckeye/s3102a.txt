<LAUGH-oh> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> that's how i feel <VOCNOISE> that's that's what i <LAUGH-belie=believe> <SIL> i choose to believe that <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> oh <SIL> <CUTOFF-wo=would> <IVER>
yeah it is <IVER>
no no no it's not <SIL> you can do whatever you want <VOCNOISE> there <SIL> uh i've heard conferences where the <CUTOFF-p=prophet> <SIL> um i've heard the prophet talk about how <SIL> you should <CUTOFF-t=?> <SIL> keep in touch with the people that you <SIL> served and <VOCNOISE> or the people that you worked with and that you knew and <VOCNOISE> and that they <SIL> even if they can't <CUTOFF-re=remember> <SIL> you can't remember how to speak just try and <LAUGH> send them a <CUTOFF-le=letter?> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i've been really <LAUGH-ba=bad> about that so i feel <SIL> a lot of pressure to <UNKNOWN> i need to <VOCNOISE> i mean it's <CUTOFF-n=not?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <VOCNOISE> i just don't wanna lose contact with them <SIL> because you <SIL> get these great <SIL> friendships and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but yeah you can <VOCNOISE> there's <SIL> i know people that have <SIL> married people from their <VOCNOISE> i mean that's really not supposed to happen while you're on your mission but <VOCNOISE> when you yknow when you're done if you <VOCNOISE> wanna go back <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> is that happens too <SIL> but it's really not <SIL> looked <SIL> i mean you shouldn't <SIL> that's against <SIL> the rules <VOCNOISE> on the mission <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> if the people wanna get married <SIL> when they get home <VOCNOISE> that's fine <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> yeah that's <SIL> it's <SIL> it's another thing where you're focused trying focus on your work and <SIL> you're not allowed to <SIL> date <SIL> never alone <LAUGH> so <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> you can live where you've <SIL> served you can do whatever you want <SIL> after you're done <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <LAUGH> <IVER>
i actually <SIL> <VOCNOISE> joined the church <VOCNOISE> in uh well i don't know it was six years ago about six years ago <VOCNOISE> and they did a survey here at o s u <SIL> and they were <CUTOFF-u=um> <SIL> um just asking people <VOCNOISE> if they thought <SIL> that christ had visited america and there was a record of that <SIL> account if <SIL> do i think that would be important <SIL> and i was like <SIL> well <SIL> i think so yeah <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> but <SIL> i didn't i was kinda hesitant <SIL> i mean it took me a while to <SIL> i <SIL> read the book of mormon i really <SIL> prayed about it and <SIL> took me about six months <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and then i finally decided that i really <SIL> <CUTOFF-l=liked?> liked it and it was <SIL> what <SIL> i had been wanting <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> so that's how i decided <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no <SIL> i don't think it was because <VOCNOISE> i grew up <SIL> just <SIL> basic <SIL> not even really christian just <SIL> really <VOCNOISE> not <SIL> no real religion <VOCNOISE> and i'd been going <CUTOFF-t=to> to <CUTOFF-pre=presbyterian> presbyterian church <SIL> as i was about nineteen years old <SIL> looking for something a church <VOCNOISE> i just had a feeling that i wanted to <SIL> have that in my life <SIL> because i'd never <SIL> had that before <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> i was just looking around and i was open to anything i had listened to <SIL> eastern religions and <VOCNOISE> i've listened to the jehovah's witnesses and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and then when i <SIL> <VOCNOISE> read in <SIL> the book of mormon it's just <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> it's a feeling of like <SIL> like <SIL> i felt like <SIL> i had heard it before <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it made sense to me <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so that's why <SIL> i really <SIL> felt <SIL> at home with this and that's <SIL> why i decided <IVER>
no i never did i <SIL> i don't know of <SIL> many people that do but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> it was <VOCNOISE> also <SIL> for me i think <VOCNOISE> if i know something's true <SIL> <HES-I> <SIL> i just know it <SIL> and then <VOCNOISE> as long as it keeps on being true over and over again <SIL> if it's not just some exciting thing that <SIL> for one day <UNKNOWN> oh this is great <VOCNOISE> but like <SIL> six months later it still has the same <VOCNOISE> still ringing true <VOCNOISE> a year later two years later <SIL> then <VOCNOISE> that's how i feel <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> i read it <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i do i <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and if <SIL> i read it <VOCNOISE> every <EXT-day> <SIL> i try to <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> and i <VOCNOISE> we go to <SIL> church i have all sorts of activities that i do <VOCNOISE> and i just <CUTOFF-a=always> <SIL> always feeling like i'm reinforced <SIL> that <SIL> it's not <SIL> just some sort of <VOCNOISE> flaky idea that it's <VOCNOISE> for me that it's <SIL> um real and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and it it just <CUTOFF-a=always> always makes sense <SIL> that's important to me that i feel like it <SIL> makes sense <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yes <VOCNOISE> it does <SIL> definitely he went on a mission to texas <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> he's <SIL> he's been back for a while he's thirty two <LAUGH> well he'll be thirty two in april <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> probably it is you're right <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> i asked him what language did he have to to learn to <LAUGH-go> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no he didn't either he joined when he was sixteen <SIL> and he was catholic before <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> similar just <SIL> kind of thing with him just <IVER>
having meeting the missionaries and <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah we met <SIL> um <SIL> at <VOCNOISE> where we there's a singles <SIL> ward <VOCNOISE> where we call ward <VOCNOISE> it's on twelfth avenue <SIL> down here <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it's just where all the <SIL> single <SIL> people under thirty <SIL> go to church and there's <SIL> dances and <SIL> different activities and <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> it's at <SIL> it's at the same building actually it's <SIL> it's <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> it's used for different things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> it's kind of frustrating <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm <SIL> i <SIL> it's a <CUTOFF-go=good> it's probably good for me because <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> it's hard for me to <VOCNOISE> just sit back and let other people <VOCNOISE> believe whatever they want <LAUGH-to_believe> yknow <VOCNOISE> i just want to convince them but <SIL> i can't do that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so it's a good <SIL> exercise for me i look at it that way and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just letting them <SIL> go ahead and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> but there's things that are <SIL> difficult like <VOCNOISE> there <SIL> <UNKNOWN> the <VOCNOISE> where we go <SIL> we <SIL> we have a <SIL> temple too <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they can't go in the temple <VOCNOISE> well they can but they have to <SIL> fit <SIL> fit certain <SIL> criteria they have to be baptized and not <SIL> and follow all these health codes and all the different codes and <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> that's not what they're <SIL> <VOCNOISE> interested in doing <LAUGH-so> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and that's hard i <SIL> think <SIL> and like <SIL> going on a mission <VOCNOISE> really <SIL> they didn't understand that they're my dad was like <SIL> do they know how small you are they're sending you to siberia <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <IVER>
they didn't know <SIL> <IVER>
no <SIL> they thought it was <SIL> my dad told me later that thought i was <VOCNOISE> getting sent off and <SIL> just by myself yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
more like that <SIL> right <IVER>
<LAUGH> yeah right <VOCNOISE> real war <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<EXT-oh> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
that's all right <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
mm <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> i think his mom was pretty <SIL> yknow doesn't really talk about it wanna talk about it <VOCNOISE> he comes from <VOCNOISE> his <VOCNOISE> his <SIL> real <CUTOFF-f=family> <SIL> biological family is very <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know if guess you'd call it dysfunctional or <VOCNOISE> they're <SIL> um <SIL> he didn't live with them <SIL> after he was <SIL> fourteen or so his <SIL> it was just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so bad that <UNKNOWN> his mom couldn't take care of him and his <SIL> his siblings so <VOCNOISE> he was <SIL> pretty much on his <CUTOFF-oh=own> <SIL> own but <VOCNOISE> he was taken in by a family that was members of the <SIL> mormon church <IVER>
<NOISE> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> mm basically they didn't <SIL> legally <SIL> adopt him or anything but <VOCNOISE> they're the ones that he considers his family really <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> i mean he still keeps in contact with his <SIL> mom and his dad <SIL> but it's always kind of a <LAUGH-challenge> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they're just <SIL> her she was drinking <SIL> i mean terrible alcoholic and <VOCNOISE> very his <CUTOFF-ma=mom> his father was very abusive and they didn't weren't even married <IVER>
that he remembers <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> he remembers the stepfathers and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and that kind of thing <VOCNOISE> it's just <SIL> not good <LAUGH-stuff> <IVER>
no it was <SIL> his mom ran away is what happened <IVER>
yeah his mom <SIL> <VOCNOISE> couldn't take care of him anymore and he was like i think he was about fourteen and <VOCNOISE> he just <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> he didn't have really anywhere to go <VOCNOISE> and luckily these families had taken <SIL> his different siblings <SIL> different families took them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know how they got connected with the church because it was all church families that <SIL> took care of them <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was good for him because he's got that example <IVER>
and <SIL> so <SIL> <IVER>
i don't know if there's any particular <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> if someone knows <SIL> if anyone knew of something like that going on they would <SIL>
