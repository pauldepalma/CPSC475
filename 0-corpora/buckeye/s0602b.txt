<SIL> girls <VOCNOISE> i've never seen them take a guy out of a bar <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm not sure <SIL> it's usually the girls look younger than guys i guess i don't know <IVER>
because they f always dress up and everything when they go to the bars <IVER>
so <VOCNOISE> i mean the cops are just looking for people that look younger <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> they don't have time to go and look at the stamps on everyone's hands and <IVER>
check their i d's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> guys will drink at the bar girls usually drink before the bar <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> as is my experience <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> because the girls are afraid and paranoid of getting caught with <CUTOFF-clipping=another <SIL> with a container at the bar <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> the guys think it's macho or whatever to be able to buy beer <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah four nights a week sometimes <IVER>
<SIL> recently it's been like <SIL> saturdays <SIL> <IVER>
that's about it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
yeah because there's no fear of being caught by the parents <IVER>
there's no one to like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> check up on you <VOCNOISE> in your dorm room <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> you're pretty much in control of your life at this point <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't <IVER>
i don't really remember october if that <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i still had a three point two <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
first quarter <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i s <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i moved into the dorms <VOCNOISE> late september <VOCNOISE> last fall <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> me and my <CUTOFF-f=friends> <SIL> two or <VOCNOISE> two other of my roommates <VOCNOISE> <SIL> took a trip i went skydiving white water rafting and skydiving again right before we moved in <IVER>
like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> skydiving wednesday <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> white water rafting thursday and friday skydiving saturday move in sunday <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> the skydiving's <VOCNOISE> up by wooster <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> and then the white water rafting is down in west virginia on the new river <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and i'm trying to work on my license for skydiving though <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i really didn't start <SIL> drinking until probably <VOCNOISE> <SIL> early <VOCNOISE> or late last summer <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> right before college and then <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> couple times nothing really big <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i know a lot of my friends did but i didn't <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know how <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you would define it as serious at this point <SIL> because college is mostly binge drinking <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think the real problem comes when you start drinking alone and everyday <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> because i mean when your friends aren't around and there's no parties to go to you usually don't drink <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> i'd say my ex girlfriend <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she could drink more than i could <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> she'd sit <VOCNOISE> up in their room and drink alone sometimes <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
a little bit <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
her mom's a severe alcoholic <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>

and we went back to our room and we watched a movie and my roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

yeah <VOCNOISE> that's want <LAUGH-to> <LAUGH-do> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i've been playing video games since i was two <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just to get in the school <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's about <SIL> thirty people applying they let three in <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> to the art and tech department <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> you have to take a foundation of courses <IVER>
<SIL> which consists of <SIL> art one sixty two through art <SIL> two sixty <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> then you submit a portfolio in the fall for review <VOCNOISE> and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>

yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
no he doesn't have a problem with it at all <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh when i was a senior in high school i wish <SIL> my parents would've pushed me to do something practical but i'm glad they didn't <SIL> because it gave me a chance to make my own decision <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> well it would've been <VOCNOISE> <SIL> something that they would've supported and something that <SIL> i would've probably been pretty good at <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they would've made it so i wouldn't have had to make the decision <VOCNOISE> i mean that was <VOCNOISE> a hard decision to <LAUGH-make> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> thinking about journalism <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> design <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
