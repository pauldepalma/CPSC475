<SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
his yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> i think it was just a political thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i haven't i haven't heard the rest of the story <SIL> but <SIL> um what i've heard of <SIL> i mean <SIL> in <SIL> in court he wouldn't have a chance <SIL> a snowball's <LAUGH-chance_of_ever> <SIL> <IVER>
<UNKNOWN-ever??> <SIL> actually being able to <SIL> to rescind the funding but still <SIL> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a <SIL> <LAUGH-it's> <SIL> we don't like to think <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-about_these> things happening <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> a little bit yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-well> well i know about the gorilla masks <SIL> <LAUGH-and_and_the> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that uh yknow i <UNKNOWN-word_word> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a a women's organization <CUTOFF-tha=that> <SIL> uh <SIL> to promote women artists <SIL> and and to um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-obje=object> object to the <SIL> to male hierarchy <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-th=the?> <SIL> that only only men get are in the museums and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> only men get the big <SIL> gallery shows and stuff like that <IVER>
<SIL> i <CUTOFF-d=don't> i don't think so <SIL> in new york it might be <SIL> i mean like i say it's a lot more competitive there here <SIL> i think <SIL> i think <SIL> columbus <SIL> is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and the mid west in general <SIL> i <SIL> think is much <SIL> more open <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> to <UNKNOWN-word_word> <SIL> yknow to art whatever it is wherever it comes from <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and there's not the isn't yknow there's not <SIL> the <SIL> the <SIL> old boy network <SIL> yknow <SIL> not as not as much who you know <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> to get into things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <CUTOFF-o=or> <SIL> or <CUTOFF-th=that> <SIL> or that <SIL> women are allowed to know the people <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that the boys know <SIL> so it's not <SIL> it's not as closed off that <SIL> way <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> ah <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah it's true i i <SIL> i <SIL> i had jansen and i <SIL> i'm yknow that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> course i was <SIL> i went to art school so jansen was just in case you had to look something up it was there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> our lecturers were all <LAUGH-pretty_pretty_liberal> <SIL> so that yknow <CUTOFF-w=we?> <SIL> that the art history <CUTOFF-g=?> <SIL> we got was <SIL> was different than <SIL> what would be <SIL> what would just be in jansen so i never <SIL> thought about that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
lots of people who <SIL> jansen is their only exposure <SIL> would <LAUGH-think> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> gee i wonder why women don't do <LAUGH-art> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but historically <SIL> yknow women <SIL> were <CUTOFF-no=not> yknow <SIL> it was a man's field and and yknow even women who were doing it and doing it well didn't get <SIL> the attention didn't get <IVER>
<SIL> they didn't make it into the history books yeah <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <UNKNOWN-word_word> but <CUTOFF-ya=yknow> yknow i mean that would that's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's <SIL> <LAUGH-civilization_wide> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think so <SIL> i think so if you're willing and yknow <SIL> anybody who's willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to <SIL> yknow that you have to sell yourself there's <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're not gonna just sit around and wait to be discovered <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <SIL> if you put out the effort i really <CUTOFF-do=don't> <SIL> i don't think there's <SIL> that kind of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that kind of discrimination anymore <SIL> <IVER>
badly <LAUGH-I <VOCNOISE> <SIL> marketing is not my strong suit i mean most of the stuff that i get is just <SIL> is a <SIL> is an accident i started working for o s u because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> another <SIL> uh illustrator that they used who wasn't gonna be able to do the work anymore recommended me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow that kind of thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but he was a guy <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
well there's <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> i'm pretty much <SIL> you just <SIL> keep making calls making appointments <VOCNOISE> sending out slides <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um it helps if you can get a <CUTOFF-re=referral> <SIL> yknow if you know an artist who's <SIL> in a gallery <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=if> yknow if you can <SIL> use them as a <CUTOFF-ref=referral> <SIL> as a reference <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but that <SIL> it's <SIL> it's mainly just <CUTOFF-sh=?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> you <SIL> just have to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh knock on a lot of doors <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and be prepared for a lot of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> of <SIL> no's <IVER>
