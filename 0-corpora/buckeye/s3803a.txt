saw a lot of stuff like that and met a lot of <CUTOFF-people> <IVER>
yeah i met a lot of different people in there <VOCNOISE> lot of interesting people <IVER>
um <SIL> i helped them set up different things helped them <SIL> yknow clean them up afterwards prep patients <VOCNOISE> all kinds of different things <SIL> there was a lot of blood and stuff but <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> when you <SIL> when it's not you it seems a little <LAUGH> easier to <SIL> observe i <LAUGH-guess> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> when you see somebody you know it's a little <SIL> more concerning to you i don't know <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> you'd see a lot of different stuff and <VOCNOISE> you hope that the majority of it's <SIL> helping this person out now my wife yknow she works <VOCNOISE> she worked in intensive care open heart surgery different patients like that <VOCNOISE> <EXT-and> that's a lot different than where she is now <SIL> with the cancer because there's so many different factors there you're <VOCNOISE> you know <CUTOFF-wih=?> she says it's so hard to see somebody <SIL> thirty years old and <VOCNOISE> they come in and they have <SIL> uh <ERROR-s=breast> breast cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things she says yknow <VOCNOISE> two or three times a week yknow your <SIL> your heart just drops out because you see that they have their little kids and <VOCNOISE> now you're gonna be going for chemotherapy radiation all this stuff yknow <VOCNOISE> it's unbelievable how many <SIL> it's just hard to believe how many <SIL> people <SIL> go through there <VOCNOISE> they're talking fifty sixty patients a day <IVER>
where she works and this is just o s u's breast cancer place so <IVER>
it <CUTOFF-ju=just> i just <VOCNOISE> i can't believe there's that many people that <SIL> need the service all the time <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> there's like five or six different doctors and <VOCNOISE> so she's learned a lot more <SIL> now than cancer because she's never been in oncology at all so <VOCNOISE> it was always just trauma patients or open heart <SIL> bypass patients things like that <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> it's been a whole new learning experience for her too <IVER>
oh no she has to do yeah it's chaos up there <VOCNOISE> it is chaos <SIL> it's i mean they had somebody come in to <VOCNOISE> oversee the whole <SIL> setup to <EXT-see> <VOCNOISE> yknow where they needed more help at whether they needed more nurses or <CUTOFF-the=that> and the guy <SIL> told her the person that was in charge the head nurse or whatever <VOCNOISE> there's no way that person can do that job <SIL> yknow <SIL> they still do it yknow <VOCNOISE> so when you're in charge it's just a nightmare you're supposed to know where every single patient is where their chart is what's going on what room they're in where yknow <VOCNOISE> you're just <SIL> walking around like you're a crazy person all day <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH-then> <VOCNOISE> then it's come home <LAUGH-yknow> <LAUGH-then> <LAUGH-it's> come home to that <VOCNOISE> and it's so different it's i don't know it's just <VOCNOISE> the motherly thing the <NOISE-kids> just <VOCNOISE> yknow they draw to their mothers <IVER>
it's just the way it is i guess but <VOCNOISE> it's like yknow she says if the mother's in the house the mother's on duty <IVER>
because yknow they <SIL> they bypass me straight mom mom mom <SIL> yknow <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah_and> she's just like <SIL> yeah the minute we walk in the door <VOCNOISE> it's like you guys <SIL> clock out <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow> <IVER>
yeah oh yeah the five year old just <VOCNOISE> after her the whole time the minute she walks in the door yknow <IVER>
go go go so <VOCNOISE> it's tough <IVER>
oh they i do <IVER>
i try to be as much as possible too i think it it's very important that <SIL> both parents <VOCNOISE> they see both <IVER>
i do <IVER>
most my friends <IVER>
most people i associate with in this and that are <VOCNOISE> a lot more involved in their with their kids than <SIL> say our parents were as kids yknow <IVER>
oh no <VOCNOISE> no <SIL> i don't feel that at all they <SIL> yknow <SIL> we don't hesitate <SIL> our <VOCNOISE> to get together with other friends and take our kids places i don't remember my dad doing that stuff yknow two or three dads get together and take six kids <VOCNOISE> to the park or something yknow <VOCNOISE> i don't remember things like that <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> he could've been there maybe but <IVER>
yknow we take them to wyandot lake or yknow the zoo or all types of things <VOCNOISE> oh yeah we got a <SIL> the best thing you gotta get a membership to everything that's what we figured out we got cosi we got the zoo and we got wyandot lake <VOCNOISE> and that way you can go whenever you want <VOCNOISE> if <SIL> an hour into the show <VOCNOISE> they're not participating properly <SIL> you can leave and you <CUTOFF-d=didn't> you're not out <LAUGH-anything> yknow yeah <VOCNOISE> yknow that cosi's great we really like that <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> really <IVER>
oh <IVER>
oh yeah we're members of there <IVER>
oh yeah we've probably been five six times already <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
it's huge <IVER>
you can't see it in a day <IVER>
you can't especially with kids <SIL> it's just too overwhelming <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
at cosi <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yep <VOCNOISE> yep there's a big water area it's something to do with the little mermaid or whatever <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> they really enjoy <SIL> all that <SIL> we try to <VOCNOISE> do as much as we can with them <SIL> outdoor type of thing we do a lot of <EXT-camping> <VOCNOISE> we do a lot of vacationing we try to go two times a year at least <VOCNOISE> uh her parents live in cape cod so they <IVER>
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have family in hawaii we have family in <VOCNOISE> virginia beach so <IVER>
everybody's <CUTOFF-co=coastal> <IVER>
everybody's coastal but us <IVER>
and my sister lives in the middle of <LAUGH-Nebraska> <LAUGH> nobody visits <LAUGH-her> <LAUGH> nobody wants <LAUGH-to_go> to nebraska <VOCNOISE> yeah what's out there <UNKNOWN> come watch the corn grow <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> she does <SIL> she comes back a lot <SIL> they <IVER>
yeah they really like it they have a huge house <SIL> in the <SIL> middle of nowhere out on a <EXT-farm> and <VOCNOISE> my brother in law bought <SIL> uh <SIL> his father's <SIL> wendy's businesses out <SIL> and so they own like six wendy's out there so <VOCNOISE> but it's out in the middle of nowhere that was the whole problem we tried to get him to move and tried to get him to do this years and years ago and <VOCNOISE> nobody wanted to move to nebraska he was doing them from ohio which is really duh <VOCNOISE> running five wendy's in nebraska and commuting <SIL> so he was <VOCNOISE> either driving or flying a lot <IVER>
no i think <SIL> <HES-I> think they fly to omaha <SIL> so it's not too bad that's pretty easy to get into <IVER>
they're about two hours west of omaha <SIL> so <SIL> it's different for them <IVER>
they're liking it yknow <VOCNOISE> small <EXT-town> <VOCNOISE> living out in the country raising the kids yknow their big house huge yard dog yknow <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> we keep looking and saying yknow now how's this different or better for the kids so <IVER>
they're uh five hours from <EXT-Colorado> so they still bad lands aren't too far <HES-away> <VOCNOISE> and i guess it's like <SIL> nine hundred miles from here so they can still drive back <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> they come <SIL> at least once twice a year <SIL> back to ohio <IVER>
okay <IVER>
no big deal <SIL>
