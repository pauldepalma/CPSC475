<NOISE> <SIL> and then <SIL> it's different businesses like white castle <EXT-or> <SIL> pizza <SIL> one of the pizza places and <SIL> uh <SIL> some of the supermarkets and things and they're advertised yknow <SIL> throughout the community <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so these kids when they have problems they <SIL> might wanna go to huckleberry house and they don't have a way so they go to a safe house <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they call and they have a <SIL> yknow group of volunteers would go out and pick these kids up <VOCNOISE> take them to huckleberry house <SIL> which isn't far from here <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i did that for a while but uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> wasn't very uh <SIL> satisfying <SIL> because i really didn't feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at huckleberry house <IVER>
well they only keep them there like for yknow a day or so <SIL> and then they um <SIL> try to <SIL> intervene with their family <SIL> put them back with their family <SIL> or um <SIL> maybe call in children's sevices and i <SIL> and i just really don't think much of children's services so <IVER>
<SIL> yknow i just got out of it <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
no <SIL> <VOCNOISE> with the system <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes <SIL> uh <SIL> <CUTOFF-mo=most> uh yknow a lot of the <CUTOFF-fo=foster> yknow there's <SIL> people with good intentions but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i just think that it just needs to be restructured totally different way <SIL> and uh <SIL> yknow maybe pull these kids uh <SIL> into more of a group <SIL> setting or something and give them more um <SIL> yknow counseling uh professional <SIL> yknow counseling <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because it's um <SIL> yknow i i didn't have good experiences with <VOCNOISE> foster homes and <SIL> and i know of a lot of kids <SIL> yknow they're saying that <SIL> i think the parents have too many <SIL> rights <SIL> yknow in the courts <SIL> and there's just a lot going on yknow that <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> it's not gonna get better it's gonna get worse yknow with the way families are torn apart now <SIL> and uh <SIL> yknow <SIL> mothers have to work and <SIL> uh <SIL> you just can't yknow stay home and be that uh <SIL> yknow perfect mom <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> so there's just a lot going on <SIL> uh <SIL> that needs to be restructured <SIL> so <IVER>
the runaways <VOCNOISE> uh well <VOCNOISE> i think the youngest that i met was maybe <EXT-twelve> <VOCNOISE> but that's yknow still young <IVER>
i picked up one kid he <SIL> he had been in uh <SIL> he was only about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> fifteen <VOCNOISE> he was adopted <VOCNOISE> and he ran away <IVER>
he was having problems with his adopted mother <SIL> and he was in a <SIL> an all <UNKNOWN> <SIL> all night restaurant <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> and he was bragging yknow that he met this man <SIL> and the man took him home <SIL> yknow and he slept at the man's place <VOCNOISE> and i was telling her do you know how dangerous that yknow that could have been for you <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> he thought it was cool <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> so yknow just things like that <IVER>
he was lucky <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> he was lucky <NOISE> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> excuse me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> typically what i observed is conflict yknow with mom <SIL> most of the time <SIL> uh <SIL> well i think a lot of times when there's a stepfather involved yknow that becomes a problem for some of them <SIL> but <SIL> they said <SIL> yknow you might run into a case where yknow the family's abusing <SIL> uh <SIL> the child <SIL> yknow but i didn't run into that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
really <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah go in there and find out yknow is the kid being abused if the kids being abused <SIL> yknow take him out <SIL> yknow forget the parents rights <SIL> yknow <SIL> or um <SIL> yeah yknow if they're using drugs put them somewhere yknow <SIL> and get them yknow get them <SIL> in rehab yknow keep them there <SIL> yknow just don't <SIL> throw them there for three days and then throw them out <VOCNOISE> it's a lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes <SIL> where nothing's getting accomplished <IVER>
in a way yeah i think that would be good <SIL> yeah <SIL> maybe a new name <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah they had those back when i was a teen they wanted to send me to one of those <SIL> my father wouldn't allow it <SIL> because uh <SIL> it was <SIL> integrated <IVER>
