kept promoting <VOCNOISE> and then all of sudden about nineties they came around and said <VOCNOISE-hey> yknow what <VOCNOISE> our <CUTOFF-kr=?> our deficit is going the other <EXT-way> <SIL> we're <VOCNOISE> we're going way out of whack on this thing <VOCNOISE> that's because we've been spending more <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-consumers> are doing the same thing <VOCNOISE> they haven't <EXT-learned> that mom and dad remember <VOCNOISE> mom when out and got a little piece as the time as they needed things <VOCNOISE> no i want the whole house completely furnished i want the cars <VOCNOISE> we don't talk about buying <VOCNOISE-cars> nowadays we talk about leasing cars <VOCNOISE> and pretty soon we're not gonna be buying houses we'll be leasing houses from the finance companies <VOCNOISE> we won't be owning the land the finance company own the <VOCNOISE> you don't own it <SIL> you're leasing it <VOCNOISE> and that's our quality of <EXT-life> <VOCNOISE> and when we go to third world countries we say <VOCNOISE> i don't know how they can stand living here <VOCNOISE> and <EXT-yet> <VOCNOISE> yknow what <VOCNOISE> they probably have better quality of understanding one another <VOCNOISE> then we do <VOCNOISE> because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further you become apart <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you said were their governments <CUTOFF-respons=responsible> <VOCNOISE> government stays out of <EXT-things> <SIL> that's our problem <VOCNOISE> government's <VOCNOISE> into too many things <VOCNOISE> they need to be <VOCNOISE> out of your nose <SIL> <CUTOFF-wi=with> <VOCNOISE> that's your personal business they need to be out of your business <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=and> <IVER>
the personal thing is you need to have <VOCNOISE> ethics <IVER>
in the business world <VOCNOISE> in other words <VOCNOISE> i used to work <VOCNOISE> uh during <HES-uh> highschool days <VOCNOISE> for a furniture company <HES-and> back in those days it was nine days <SIL> <VOCNOISE-cash> <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> we'd sell it to people and the <VOCNOISE> and i said well gee <VOCNOISE> we just <VOCNOISE> and we talked to the manager <VOCNOISE> oh they they don't have the <CUTOFF-mon=money> they don't have the money that's financed the <EXT-bank> <VOCNOISE> well why are we selling it to them then <VOCNOISE> well we'll get our money back and the bank bank get the money and we'll get a <CUTOFF-f=?> we'll repossess it <VOCNOISE> and we sold the same darn thing over three or four <EXT-times> <SIL> this poor sucker is out there get stuck with credit ratings <VOCNOISE> the bank's making money <VOCNOISE> we're making money <VOCNOISE> they're losing <VOCNOISE> now is that business ethics <VOCNOISE> i ask you <VOCNOISE> is it no <UNKNOWN> is it proper business <CUTOFF-eth=ethics> ethics <IVER>
that's where we need to correct <IVER>
that's where you need to correct <VOCNOISE> you can't just say <VOCNOISE> hey we got a schnook out here we can screw him <VOCNOISE> that's a <VOCNOISE> problem <VOCNOISE> and you're saying does it <CUTOFF-t_ih=??> does it does it take home does it take church <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> takes morals <VOCNOISE> and that's why i was telling before we got away from morals in our society <VOCNOISE> we could care less about you <VOCNOISE> i always say a <CUTOFF-s=salesman> a uh good successful salesman will be able to sell his own mother <VOCNOISE> i mean sell his own mother <VOCNOISE> on a <CUTOFF-n=on> on the market <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you're not gonna make as much <VOCNOISE-money> the people are gonna say gee i'm not going to them <UNKNOWN> i'm <UNKNOWN> place else <VOCNOISE> again it gets back to weaknesses in our standards in society <VOCNOISE> we we could care less about anybody else <VOCNOISE> we don't <VOCNOISE> hey if i have problems <VOCNOISE> the government is gonna help me out <VOCNOISE> that's a mindset that's been entrenched for forty some <EXT-years> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-it's> a mindset <VOCNOISE> that if you talk to the older generations are dying off now <VOCNOISE> that said we would never had in our lifetime <VOCNOISE> it's a ruination of our <VOCNOISE> country <VOCNOISE> and if you are old enough to remember kruschev <VOCNOISE> i believe krushchev is right we will bury you <VOCNOISE> we'll bury you internally in other words we will break you up you will separate internally you have dysfunctional people we are <VOCNOISE> we're dysfunctional families <VOCNOISE> if you ever work on pastoral care activity you'll find out that people <VOCNOISE> are so concerned about their families <VOCNOISE> that they <CUTOFF-f=fail> <VOCNOISE> they fail <VOCNOISE> they think because their family is broken up they've got <VOCNOISE> single parents here they've got <VOCNOISE> divorced here <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> they don't know what's going on they're doing drugs <VOCNOISE> well the <VOCNOISE> problem is we never got involved <VOCNOISE> as you said busy <VOCNOISE> we make more time yknow there's more time <VOCNOISE> spent for soccer on sunday <VOCNOISE> then going to church <VOCNOISE> you talk about <VOCNOISE> uh they said was it meet the press <CUTOFF-quo=quote> as i think slogan is <VOCNOISE> a <VOCNOISE-day> without meet <VOCNOISE> a sunday without meet the press <VOCNOISE> yknow day <UNKNOWN> was it <VOCNOISE> something like <HES-uh> sunday's not a sunday without meet the <EXT-Press> <SIL> well hey <VOCNOISE> that just tells you right there <VOCNOISE> where our thoughts <EXT-are> <SIL> we're <EXT-only> <VOCNOISE-thinking> of ourselves <VOCNOISE> i guarantee it as you get older <VOCNOISE> you start thinking a little differently <VOCNOISE> and i think as you talk you should be talking to some older people <VOCNOISE> i'm saying people um in the in their eighties <VOCNOISE> to find out how the progression of life is <VOCNOISE> and how you think <VOCNOISE> because when you go to estate sales <VOCNOISE> all you're talking about this profit motive <VOCNOISE> you're sitting on a lawns <VOCNOISE> the quality of life <VOCNOISE> is in the mind the person you're <VOCNOISE> you you avoided all the time <IVER>
and that's what we're concerned with <VOCNOISE> you need to interact more with people we need to interact more people <SIL> every day of our life that's what we <VOCNOISE> learn <VOCNOISE> from <VOCNOISE> we don't learn by giving <VOCNOISE> things to people <VOCNOISE> just like if you were um <SIL> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> a parent giving a giving allowance you don't give them to <VOCNOISE> your kids uh money to do chores and that you don't expect them to do <VOCNOISE> but you give them something in addition <VOCNOISE> to develop more responsibility <VOCNOISE> but we don't talk about responsibility in our society today <VOCNOISE> i i <VOCNOISE> i dare you to say we're in a <CUTOFF-h_eh_k=?> <VOCNOISE> they say publicly <VOCNOISE> this is <VOCNOISE> our bill of responsibility <VOCNOISE> do you know where there is <SIL> <NOISE> do we talk about responsibilities now <IVER>
if you if <VOCNOISE> if if you say buy <VOCNOISE> buy from those <VOCNOISE> unscrupulous business people and say <VOCNOISE> ah gee these guys got it on credit <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> what happens to that person <VOCNOISE> that files bankruptcy <VOCNOISE> ah <VOCNOISE> file bankruptcy it's okay <VOCNOISE> i'll do something else <VOCNOISE> next time <IVER>
we start them over again <VOCNOISE> they have never learned <VOCNOISE> and reason why <VOCNOISE> you're throwing out <VOCNOISE-carrying> out too <VOCNOISE> much in front of them without saying hey <VOCNOISE> you gotta do this to prove this to me <VOCNOISE> <EXT-no> we we we <VOCNOISE> lack <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> one heck a lot of <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-ethical> moral standards in this country we're losing it every day <VOCNOISE> and until we start looking at ourselves in in the mirror at night and say <VOCNOISE> i'm proud of myself i'm proud of what i did <VOCNOISE> i may not have made a dollar <EXT-today> <VOCNOISE> but i understood somebody <EXT-today> <IVER>
no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <HES-I> <IVER>
<EXT-I> i <VOCNOISE> i don't think it's necessarily that i think it's comes back to the lack of self discipline <IVER>
no i <VOCNOISE> you had women that working before <VOCNOISE> you had <VOCNOISE> women working before <VOCNOISE> but self discipline is <UNKNOWN> family <VOCNOISE> it's part of it <SIL> self discipline <VOCNOISE> making things too easy for us oh we <VOCNOISE-can't> do without it <VOCNOISE> you ever <VOCNOISE> you ever try to work for something i mean you really struggle to to achieve something <SIL> did it mean more to you than something that was given to you <VOCNOISE> tell me <IVER>
but but was if that if that but if that p h d was given to you <VOCNOISE> if they lowered the standards <VOCNOISE> if they lowered the standards <VOCNOISE> for you to get into <VOCNOISE> graduate <EXT-school> <VOCNOISE> it wouldn't that be challenging for you hey great they lowered it for me <VOCNOISE> my sister didn't have oh she had a rough time getting in but now i can get in anywhere i got a lower <CUTOFF-sta=standard> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
