help <IVER>
i do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i am against religion in school <SIL> i just don't think <SIL> they should push that on people <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> you know <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean i don't think they should make people pray if they don't want to before class or anything <SIL> yknow like that <VOCNOISE> but as far as morals and the right <SIL> thing to do in life and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what's out there and <SIL> yknow most kids know what the wrong thing is but <IVER>
um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> i think through education <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's <SIL> it's just gonna <SIL> only help <IVER>
kids because a lot times maybe they don't get that at home <VOCNOISE> so they're really looking <SIL> to choose the right thing to do <VOCNOISE> and through school and <CUTOFF-clipping=word> through education <VOCNOISE> that's their avenue to go there <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> so unfortunately <SIL> yknow and i guess i never thought of it <VOCNOISE> a lot more pressure is put on <VOCNOISE> schools and education now <SIL> <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and these schools that have a thousand people i just can't imagine <SIL> i mean yknow my my high school was like <SIL> four hundred people and we <SIL> thought that was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> big at the time <VOCNOISE> and just to have a thousand <CUTOFF-pee=people> <NOISE> excuse <SIL> me people and <SIL> just to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> try to monitor different things i mean it's gotta be so <SIL> hard <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know <SIL> in checking everything and <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
i just think it's sad even here in columbus yknow like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools <NOISE> and i thought <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just <SIL> yknow it just could because <SIL> of all the things you've seen in the world <SIL> in the last few year <VOCNOISE> that these kids want to do this just to see <SIL> what's gonna happen <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yknow it's it's just sad <SIL> in our society that that's what it's <SIL> turning to <IVER>
i went to brook haven <SIL> which is uh <SIL> up on karl road <VOCNOISE> <SIL> near northland mall <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> yep <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yes <SIL> i do <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> honestly growing up <SIL> we didn't have we <SIL> it wasn't really called sex ed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> they talked about the female reproductive system <SIL> nothing about men which is kind of funny <SIL> yknow it was always the women <SIL> and that chart yknow <IVER>
and those <SIL> tubes and all that i mean i remember seeing that like in eighth grade and looking that thinking that's me yknow <IVER>
<SIL> um <IVER>
but with <SIL> kids and they're just so much <SIL> more <SIL> active at a early age <IVER>
<SIL> yknow and i hear about kids <SIL> twelve <CUTOFF-th=third> thirteen <LAUGH> <SIL> luckily i wasn't that early <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think <SIL> once they start <SIL> yknow like sixth grade they really <SIL> should relate to them <SIL> <IVER>
um <IVER>
<SIL> i <SIL> think that's too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow with aids and that as <SIL> rampant it is is now and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there are so many more women that have it <SIL> um started off it was mostly men <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> women have got to know <SIL> as <CUTOFF-ah=at> at an early age <SIL> yknow <SIL> about these different diseases and things <IVER>
and i think that <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> the morals being <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> especially <SIL> at a young age yknow abstinence is the best policy <VOCNOISE> so many people <SIL> i <SIL> i <SIL> think they are <VOCNOISE> turning to they're not gonna <NOISE> have any <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> thing <LAUGH> do anything before they're married um <VOCNOISE> but in today's life <NOISE> once you get in to college and stuff it's a little hard to <VOCNOISE> but i think a lot more kids are going <VOCNOISE> that route <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because my <SIL> parents never talked to me about sex <VOCNOISE> we all learned it from our friends <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> my mother was very open <NOISE> but i think in today's world <VOCNOISE> because really there wasn't <SIL> <NOISE> there wasn't that many <SIL> diseases <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow there was but <VOCNOISE> you just didn't hear about it <IVER>
and the pregnancies and all the unwanted children and everything like that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i just heard this week that in france they have <VOCNOISE> uh that morning after pill <IVER>
and you know i just really think they need to make that <VOCNOISE> and not <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> an option <SIL> for a young girl <VOCNOISE> i really do because there's just <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> there's just too many unwanted children <NOISE> there just is and that really bothers me <SIL> that we don't have another option <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like another <SIL> country <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> we're a lot more right wing here in america <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i just feel that's got to be an option <NOISE> yknow for these young girls <VOCNOISE> it just really does <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <SIL> <IVER>
right <IVER>
well <IVER>
but i <SIL> think it should be an option <VOCNOISE> you know i'm really <SIL> you know for women's right and everything because i was single for so long <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i just feel <SIL> if a man could have a child <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it would be different but since women are the only ones that can <VOCNOISE> then it's <SIL> ultimate <SIL> ultimately should be our choice <SIL> i really do <SIL> and i think <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know we should have every option available <VOCNOISE> <SIL> especially when you're young <SIL> no girl should have to go through <SIL> you know <SIL> pregnancy and everything even if it's a mistake or whatever i just <SIL> you know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it ruins their lives <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when they don't have the option <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
well <SIL> i think at that age the <SIL> parents should be involved <SIL> and hopefully they'll be open minded enough to know that this is going to be something she's going to have the rest of her life <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'll tell you what with today's <SIL> world <SIL> and some of these fourteen year olds <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that look like they're twenty <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> you know <SIL> they <SIL> they know what they're doing <SIL> and no they shouldn't keep <SIL> repeating that <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> i just think <SIL> the most important thing is is for them to be able to have the option <SIL> i really do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but yes the parents should be involved i'd say to the age <SIL> seventeen maybe <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know i <SIL> think they should have a <SIL> parent's consent and hopefully <VOCNOISE> the parents will love their daughter enough to realize <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> what a <SIL> mistake it's going to be if <SIL> she's gonna be young mother and then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> eventually maybe not even want to be a mother <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just <SIL> they kill them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow and there's so much that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> for a while there that was going on and it's like you <SIL> i can't believe these women are doing this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they just snap <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'll be honest <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i have a lot of homosexual friends <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> being in the restaurant business and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> growing up in the restaurant business and that's how i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> really kind of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> met them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i was going to school i didn't know any <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i went to o u and honestly down there i didn't know <SIL> i didn't know anybody was gay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i feel <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <SIL> a lot of people were i'll say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> most of them <SIL> or all of them <SIL> are born that way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> some of them do make a choice <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i <SIL> feel that <VOCNOISE> it should be <VOCNOISE> <SIL> talked about in school <VOCNOISE> um for so long <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was in the closet <LAUGH> <SIL> yknow they didn't talk about it and these kids yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> had to hide it and i just think in today's world and there's so many people that are openly gay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it should be talked about more in school <SIL> i do <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> especially <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just think some <VOCNOISE> and women <SIL> there's <SIL> women that <SIL> you know i had <SIL> my gym teacher brook haven now that i look at it <VOCNOISE> i didn't know then <VOCNOISE> but she was gay <VOCNOISE> i mean we didn't <SIL> i didn't think that then i don't know why but she was very manly but she was very <VOCNOISE> she was very good but she was <VOCNOISE> you know just <SIL> not <SIL> feminine at all <IVER>
and not that that changed my opinion of her <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> back then and nobody would talk about it <SIL> and <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just think <SIL> in today's world <SIL> we need to bring <VOCNOISE> <SIL> subjects like that out <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no one <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because there's so many people who are ashamed about <SIL> things <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they shouldn't be ashamed because it's a lifestyle anymore <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i just <SIL> it needs to be brought up more <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well but see i think if you <SIL> really try to tell <SIL> kids and especially women <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> yknow you shouldn't <SIL> sex is something that <SIL> should be between two people that love each other <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and unless you really <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> feel love and really <SIL> think <SIL> it is love then <SIL> yknow <SIL> you shouldn't do it <IVER>
um i know that's a lot easier said than done <VOCNOISE> because <SIL> you fall in love every other week sometimes when you're young <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i don't think it encourages it <NOISE> i just think in <SIL> you know they show so much on t v it's all yknow people are <SIL> nude on at ten o clock at night on these shows <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and these girls are watching it <VOCNOISE> i mean granted most of them are adults <SIL> but on the soap operas and stuff it's a different story <VOCNOISE> so they're seeing it anyways <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> you just i think if you're open enough with your children these parents <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and say you know we <CUTOFF-w=want> <SIL> we want to give you this option we really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> prefer you don't do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected <IVER>
i mean i think that's the best way to <NOISE> address it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who <SIL> say well maybe i'm gay i don't know if i'm gay or what <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> hopefully <SIL> they'll know <SIL> their true identity <SIL> eventually <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i mean yes some people <SIL>
