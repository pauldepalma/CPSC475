that's right <LAUGH> <LAUGH-that's_right> <LAUGH> <SIL> it's a parakeet <IVER>
a parakeet yes <SIL> little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
oh <SIL> wow yeah <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i had that with uh <SIL> the parakeet i had before <VOCNOISE> their lifespan in the wild is about five years seven years in captivity and he was thirteen <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> the hardest <CUTOFF-bo=both> both the hardest and easiest thing i think i've ever done <SIL> was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him euthanized <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
hum <SIL> right <SIL> you know you have to you know you don't have a choice but at the same time you <CUTOFF-duh=don't> right you don't want them to suffer but you want to keep them <SIL> but <SIL> it is <VOCNOISE> whoops <SIL> oops <SIL> i hope i didn't move <IVER>
put my hand here <SIL> try to keep it out the line of the <SIL> wire <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah no problem <IVER>
yes <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
me too <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i really don't know i don't understand why they don't because to me <SIL> it's the most important freedom we have <SIL> and people v um <SIL> bitch and complain all the time <VOCNOISE> but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you don't because your voice <SIL> wasn't heard <SIL> um <SIL> when i was a political action consultant for the ohio education association i used to go around try to get teachers involved in politics <SIL> um and one of the things i would tell them is that <SIL> every vote is important john kennedy won if if <SIL> if you would take all of the the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation <VOCNOISE> by one vote per <CUTOFF-pers=precinct> <SIL> per precinct <SIL> one vote per precinct <SIL> yknow if there had just been one additional vote either way in any of those precincts yknow he would have lost <SIL> uh and so one vote does count <SIL> and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes <SIL> and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven <SIL> eighteen nineteen votes <SIL> um <SIL> if i knew the magic <SIL> reason why people don't vote <SIL> i could sell that <SIL> and make a <SIL> make a fortune <SIL> um but i don't know what it is <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
when i did school levy campaigns <SIL> uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is <SIL> what the <CUTOFF-c=campaign> the <VOCNOISE> campaign does on election day called get out the vote <VOCNOISE> that's the most important thing that can be done <SIL> um <SIL> i used to <SIL> always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school levy <VOCNOISE> get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district <SIL> and i would have the school district compare it to <SIL> parents and the first thing i'd do is register parents <SIL> because many of them <VOCNOISE> don't vote <SIL> uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country doesn't even begin to vote until they're forty <SIL> if i had known that when i was in college <SIL> and worked so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i couldn't vote till i was twenty one <SIL> and i was upset <SIL> yknow because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war <SIL> that was a big issue and i couldn't <SIL> uh i had to wait till i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that <SIL> yknow worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed <SIL> if i'd known that they weren't gonna vote at eighteen <SIL> and they were gonna wait until they were almost forty <SIL> i wouldn't of i wouldn't of wasted my time <SIL> um but anyway um <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade age <VOCNOISE>
