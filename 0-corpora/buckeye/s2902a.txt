<IVER>
okay so how are you gonna help them when they're all over <IVER>
used to be you lived in a little neighborhood you knew all your neighbors you don't have that now everybody is mobile <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they <ERROR-st=just> had on the news most people keep the house five to seven years before they sell it and move on <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
same <IVER>
i've been in the same house for seventeen years <IVER>
and the only way i'd move is if the neighborhood went down and <VOCNOISE> when i say went down i'm talking about way down <SIL> i like where i'm at <IVER>
and i got good neighbors <LAUGH> <IVER>
i think that influences how everybody behaves not only the kids the adults too <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> well let's put it this way i can go out and make money without even making money off the government agencies if i wanted to if i wanted to be a crook i could <VOCNOISE> i could be a crook <SIL> and uh <LAUGH> i could have people rent me a house low income i could move in there <IVER>
i could do all kinds of stuff <VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
to make money on the side <VOCNOISE> all through the government <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's what i mean it it's too easy to get away with stuff nowadays <IVER>
well <IVER>
let's put this way if your kids are in my yard doing something and i yelled at them <VOCNOISE> you're liable to come down to my house and either shoot me sue me <VOCNOISE> or have me locked up right <IVER>
when i was a kid if <VOCNOISE> neighbor yelled at me <VOCNOISE> i better make damn sure he didn't tell my dad <IVER>
because i would've gotten my ass whipped <IVER>
nowadays you don't have that <IVER>
yknow what are you going to <VOCNOISE> you hit that kid <VOCNOISE> you're going to jail <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
well is it <IVER>
i had the same thing happen to my kid <HES-I> i smacked him one time <IVER>
yknow and it was in the butt going get me wrong <VOCNOISE> he told me he was gonna have me uh locked up for child abuse <SIL> so i threw his ass in the car and took him downtown <VOCNOISE> and took him inside <SIL> and told him to tell them people <SIL> because they're gonna lock him up <IVER>
if i'm an unfit parent not me <SIL> that put a stop to that right away <IVER>
uh about twelve <IVER>
because see i'm his stepfather <IVER>
and i've heard the thing yknow you're not my real father and all that we went through all that <IVER>
that's just like i told him <SIL> take everything you got that your real father got you <IVER>
and you can hit the road if you want <VOCNOISE> of course the only thing he had was nothing <IVER>
now i got him <IVER>
i got him sounds like i bought a dog <IVER>
but yknow what i mean when he was about nine years old but he's known me <SIL> all my life <SIL> so yknow what i mean it wasn't no big shock <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> but see his father lived right around corner and never even had nothing to do with him <IVER>
but when he did have something to do with him <VOCNOISE> it was kinda strange they would go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that <IVER>
and and yknow i was <SIL> here i am in a predicament i can't say nothing to them <IVER>
yknow <SIL> that's his real father so i gotta sit there and keep my mouth shut <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
none <VOCNOISE> whatsoever <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he'll <CUTOFF-basic=basically> yeah he'll basically tell you he don't have no except for me <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
yeah but see that was coming from his <VOCNOISE-friends> more than him <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but of course whenever they needed a ride or anything like that they come to me <IVER>
yknow <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> it's just the same as when i was a kid <IVER>
it's whatever you gonna get away with <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah but fifty years ago if you had epilepsy they'd lock you in closet and throw away the key <VOCNOISE> and wouldn't let <VOCNOISE-you> out <VOCNOISE> most the parent i've seen <SIL> <HES-uh> to me i'd rather see the kids with a step parent <IVER>
because i've seen lot of bad parents <VOCNOISE> i've <CUTOFF-sh-seen> <SIL> seen a lotta bad people you know what i mean i <VOCNOISE> have <VOCNOISE-seen> <VOCNOISE> people <VOCNOISE> know you <VOCNOISE-always_hear> about drugs and all that <VOCNOISE> i've seen people sitting there drinking <IVER>
you ask where their <CUTOFF-ki=kids> i don't know he's outside somewhere <IVER>
now those people don't wanna take time nowadays it's easier just to give a kid a <SIL> beeper <IVER>
if you need them beep them <IVER>
then actually know where he's going <IVER>
every kid that my kid ran around with i knew his parents <SIL> one way or the other <IVER>
and yknow <VOCNOISE> i'd show up at their house if i thought something was going on know <SIL> yknow it don't matter to me i'm just <VOCNOISE> like said i <VOCNOISE> grew up here in columbus ohio i'm just a dumb hillbilly <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> like <CUTOFF-aw=?> <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> if they were having a party at somebody's house and their parents didn't know i'd <VOCNOISE-show> up <SIL> there asking what the hell was going on <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
<HES-and> <IVER>
no because them kids still stop at my house <IVER>
even though my kid is not there they'll stop by my house just to say hi <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and most kids don't do that nowadays <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
well <CUTOFF-al=also> <SIL> also too when is the last time you seen a baseball game <VOCNOISE> kids playing a baseball game in the neighborhood <IVER>
you don't <IVER>
<EXT-no> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
what's really weird is i can go over my mom's neighborhood <VOCNOISE> you'll still see kids playing out there in the school yard playing baseball <VOCNOISE> now i got a <SIL> school yard right next to me you come up there and you see no kids doing it <IVER>
<CUTOFF-sah=?> <SIL> it's like <SIL> each <SIL> neighborhood's got a little different <NOISE-personality> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think that's bullshit <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
my dad was crippled for <HES-uh> for nine months he was in a cast from his neck down to his ankles <IVER>
<HES-uh> he had <SIL> a hip fusion is what it was called back then they had no <SIL> artificial hips <VOCNOISE> he had one leg three inches shorter than the other and he had no hip joint <SIL> whatsoever it was just <IVER>
ground up bone <VOCNOISE> so my mom was working and uh <CUTOFF-f=?> <CUTOFF-ah=?> <VOCNOISE> this going to sound sickening <VOCNOISE> i was <VOCNOISE-twelve> years old i'd even have to come home from school and stick suppositories up him <IVER>
to take care of him i mean for twelve years old no offense <IVER>
when <VOCNOISE-that's_your> <LAUGH-dad_that's> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-that_ain't_the_best_place> to be <LAUGH-going_when_you_get_off_school_you_know> <IVER>
and <HES-uh> <SIL> it didn't hurt me none <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> i think it just depends upon like i said <VOCNOISE> a lot of factors know it's your neighborhood your neighbors <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> most kids don't have nothing to do in their neighborhood <VOCNOISE> even <SIL> and how many empty lots do you see nowadays <SIL> it still comes back to <VOCNOISE> like when i was a kid we had go carts we had mini bikes we had all that kind of stuff <IVER>
yknow <CUTOFF-ah=?> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> ain't no way in hell you have <NOISE-one> nowadays <IVER>
your kid be thrown in jail you'd be getting sued for not having insurance <IVER>
yknow <CUTOFF-it=it's?> <SIL> society again is taking away everything from you <IVER>
yes and no <VOCNOISE> uh when we were in boy scouts we got kicked out of it <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-so> <SIL> yknow what i mean we had more fun on our <EXT-own> <VOCNOISE> uh where i grew up i grew up <SIL> like i said right over here on olentangy there used to be a <SIL> pond over here at the cemetery we used to go <VOCNOISE-fishing> there everyday or <IVER>
this is in the summer now we'd go down to <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE-Olentangy> river to go <VOCNOISE-fishing> <UNKNOWN> over there where <HES-uh> <SIL> dodridge is <SIL> there used to be a bash recreation center with a miniature golf course and everything <IVER>
now what that's industrial nuclearonics or something like that <VOCNOISE> think about now you got the wetlands down there <SIL> yknow <NOISE> where are kids gonna go <IVER>
no <NOISE> not <SIL> like they used to <IVER>
the <CUTOFF-m=majority> majority are the ones that don't get the guidance <SIL> at home <SIL> that you're trying to reach ain't gonna go to boy scouts <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow> <IVER>
<HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> basically what you need more is <VOCNOISE> like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood <IVER>
where they can go everyday <SIL> the way i look at it <VOCNOISE> also <EXT-too> <HES-uh> <SIL> when i was a kid like i said i started working two jobs when i was fourteen you can't even find a job unless you're sixteen nowadays <IVER>
so it's kinda hard you know what i mean <CUTOFF-t=to> <SIL> to do a lotta things <IVER>
because <CUTOFF-they=they're> <CUTOFF-they=they're> they're saying you're still a kid but yet
