<VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> right <CUTOFF-h=he> <SIL> he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and not speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> please <SIL> <CUTOFF-Nanc=Nancy> <SIL> i changed my name when i went to college i just decided i'm out of here i'm everything's gone <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> she would say um nancy please just talk to your father just for <VOCNOISE> just for my sake <SIL> please <CUTOFF-ta=talk> <VOCNOISE> and i would think i'm the child here i shouldn't have to be the one to make peace in this family if he doesn't wanna talk to me <VOCNOISE> i don't need him i don't have to talk to him <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right yknow <IVER>
yeah yeah yeah i shouldn't have to do this <VOCNOISE> i'm not responsible for the happiness of this family <IVER>
and the fact that i recognized all that and couldn't wait to get out of there and when i was gone <SIL> i was gone <VOCNOISE> and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where <VOCNOISE> my <CUTOFF-fam=family> in fact i've been happy about them lately because <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i've well we've lived in our same house for twenty years <SIL> and my parents say they <VOCNOISE> live in florida they um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean they're not well to do by any means but they <ERROR-?> they're not lacking for anything <VOCNOISE> and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california <VOCNOISE> <SIL> twice a year <SIL> to <CUTOFF-s=spend> <SIL> they spend a week with my brother <SIL> etc etc and they come here a couple times a year <VOCNOISE> and they stay at my sister's house <SIL> they have only come to my home three times in twenty years <VOCNOISE> and that's because they don't wanna get off the freeway <SIL> they will drive through columbus <SIL> from <VOCNOISE> florida to go to visit people in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> akron and masillon and they stay in cincinnati and they stay in springfield with my sisters <SIL> and they won't do it because <SIL> it's just to <CUTOFF-mu=much> they don't wanna have to <VOCNOISE> deal with that traffic <SIL> they don't like that <SIL> and it's <SIL> and just recently i finally said <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i don't understand why you can't do that yknow i've actually called them <UNKNOWN> i'm fifty two <IVER>
you would think by now yknow <SIL> this wouldn't matter <IVER>
and my youngest daughter when i was <SIL> crabbing about it because i said i talked to them and they said well we're coming to ohio in a couple weeks and i said <VOCNOISE> oh good are you gonna come and see us <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well no we weren't <SIL> we weren't planning on it and i said well why <VOCNOISE> well we're we're not driving uh doty's renting us the car <SIL> well <SIL> all that meant was my sister was renting the car <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> he was driving the car <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> i said well well well then how are you gonna get to these other places <SIL> and normally i wouldn't do that i would just <VOCNOISE> let it go <VOCNOISE> well uh uh uh doty's renting that car and i said well are you <SIL> aren't you driving it <SIL> well well yeah but and i said <SIL> fine <SIL> and i don't wanna even think about it <SIL> so it's kind of like <IVER>
