<SIL> school board they're always stopping something and they don't seem to move forward very well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> i don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know if that's what percolates it <VOCNOISE> it's very different in the public schools the catholic school the public school <SIL> you have all the problems of society school you have the drugs you have the absentee <EXT-parents> you have the delinquency <SIL> in the catholic school they just <SIL> you don't have that for one thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh ya know it's oriented around the church even though we're not catholic <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's still oriented as so there's lot of values <SIL> that permeates everything well they don't do that in the public school because if you do that somebody's gonna get ticked off it's the wrong value and <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> why are you doing this to my kid <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> so i think that's missing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's a problem within the school <SIL> the public schools <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so just seems to be more distraction from the educational process know mean when you're in the catholic school and you're in classroom <SIL> they deal with the discipline <SIL> if they need to <SIL> <SIL> course part the <HES-problem> way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them <HES-oh> back to the <LAUGH-public> <LAUGH-schools> <VOCNOISE> uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think <HES-that> <SIL> <HES-it> <SIL> <UNKNOWN> it's harder for the teachers to teach <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> cause there's too much stuff in the way of <UNKNOWN> they <HES-need> <SIL> really they're there to do <IVER>
i don't know i hadn't thought about that <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-I> i don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i don't <SIL> i don't get the impression the values as anything <SIL> <VOCNOISE> to do with what they're doing in the school <IVER>
well i get the sense that if there are discipline problems it's so hard to get anything done <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> solve them unless you unless somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school ya know that's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the big thing now but just that ya know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just so hard to get anything <EXT-done> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they don't see the support <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> throughout through the administration and if they do have <UNKNOWN> <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> they have to wait til something's pretty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> pretty egregious before they <SIL> before it's dealt with <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> they're <HES-UNKNOWN> <ERROR-error=prevented=preventive> from doing much <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah i yeah i just don't think that they <SIL> can do much <VOCNOISE> and i <UNKNOWN> i'm sure it's very frustrating for them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well and i know it is <UNKNOWN> we got friend who's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was a teacher she just retired a couple years ago she's about our age <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <SIL> it's it's very different now <SIL> uh <SIL> you know it's she said it's scary going into the classroom sometimes <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and before it wasn't that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a <HES-UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> know go and get something dealt with it <SIL> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now you can't get backing on it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> no <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and she said ya know and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the <HES-word> the last three or four years she just rode it out so she could retire <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and she used be very dedicated <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> uh very dedicated teacher she just <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> it was a job then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <HES-so> i hate see that happen to good teachers <IVER>
right <SIL> right when it's just frustration after frustration <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> but i don't see that in the catholic school now in the catholic school they're not even paid as well as the public schools <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but the environment is <SIL> better for education <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> no <SIL> <IVER>
well my son <HES-started> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah i son started <VOCNOISE> public school for kindergarten <VOCNOISE> and he just <SIL> my son is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my son is a very social <VOCNOISE> <SIL> child we'll say <CUTOFF-he's> <SIL> he's the one that talks too much <VOCNOISE> as the teachers say he's the social <SIL> child <VOCNOISE> he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured <SIL> i mean he needs time to run around but he needs something very structured you get him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> near a bunch of <CUTOFF-kids> other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them cause he was ready to play <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah and <SIL> yeah my and my <CUTOFF-daughter> my daughter's the opposite that <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> but he would do that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> so he wasn't <SIL> he was very <CUTOFF-UNKNOWN> he wasn't <VOCNOISE> learning things <SIL> and he was constantly getting in trouble <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <UNKNOWN> i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we would be told he was a <SIL> problem but he didn't understand what was going on and it <ERROR-wasn't> there wasn't structure he would go to school everyday and not know what to expect <SIL> because there wasn't like <SIL> this <SIL> we'll do this and then we'll do this and we'll do this <VOCNOISE> so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it just was a better <CUTOFF-match> better match for him <SIL> and then <SIL> <ERROR-error=when> my daughter <SIL> went to school was just easier to take them to the same school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-and> and that goes back <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about why the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> discipline and <SIL> and behavior may be different in the catholic school is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're paying big <SIL> you're paying bucks <SIL> yknow it's four <CUTOFF-thousand> <VOCNOISE> forty five hundred dollars a year for <SIL> us <VOCNOISE> to send her to school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> and if we find out she's not doing her <SIL> work <SIL> it's <SIL> very different <LAUGH-perspective> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i think she's getting a better education than he did but <SIL> it's because she's doing the work and and she knows she's expected to has to and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he <SIL> my son's the kind he'd rather play than work and so he <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he rode a lot and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> and he and he paid for it when he got to college it was rough <CUTOFF-start> for him to start out because he was behind then <IVER>
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> no mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
oh they have religion they have a religion class they have religion everyday but some of it is just starting with prayer and bible stories and some it's more the values <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh lot those teachers aren't catholic <SIL> which <ERROR-ahvah=I i was surprised to hear that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh in fact the religion teacher that my daughter had in ninth grade she had religion class everyday wasn't catholic <IVER>
<SIL> <SIL> yeah i thought that was interesting <SIL> uh so <CUTOFF-it> it is a values <SIL> yknow <SIL> the the <UNKNOWN> christian <SIL> values thing <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i don't have problem with we had little problems like my son had to learn the hail mary <VOCNOISE> and we had to find somebody to teach it to us <VOCNOISE> write it down for us because we didn't know and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they wrote it down wrong so he learned it wrong and he got marks off <LAUGH> and we and we didn't <LAUGH-know> yeah little things like that <VOCNOISE> but it wasn't a problem <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> there was a problem <VOCNOISE> with my son for a while because the priest they had there wouldn't let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion <VOCNOISE> and that's pretty much the priest decides that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he <SIL> and he felt <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> singled out <SIL> and he was i mean he was the only one <VOCNOISE> and he was uncomfortable with that <SIL> uh <SIL> but it hasn't been a problem <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm <SIL> not a religious person myself <SIL> but i'm not against it <SIL> and if i <HES-and> <SIL> maybe i've justified it to myself by saying well they're teaching values <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no well he right now he's really interested in eastern religions i'm not sure where that came from <VOCNOISE> yknow when they go to college and they're gone and you don't see them much <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> that's what he's interested in right now <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i don't think it it it it really took <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <SIL> <ERROR-error=yeah> and <SIL> <HES-and> <HES-and> if my daughter doesn't seem ah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we have talked about some things that are <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow the pope says this is <SIL> what is and <SIL> knowing full well that this is not what we think at home <VOCNOISE> we <SIL> abortion and homosexuals and <VOCNOISE> we're <ERROR-fwer=if much more liberal than that and <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> <CUTOFF-clipping=it_just> that's where there's been a problem but we're very open about that at home <CUTOFF-clipping=and_with> with <VOCNOISE> my daughter is strong willed <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well no she sort of knows this is what she <CUTOFF-has> has to say at school <VOCNOISE> if she's asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade <IVER>
but she doesn't believe it <VOCNOISE> yeah yeah she's very pragmatic <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-yeah_she> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I_mean_she> she could probably <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well she's she's interested in physical therapy <SIL> is that what your wife is <LAUGH> oh <LAUGH-okay> <IVER>
and so you had <IVER>
physical therapist did it yeah <NOISE> <IVER>
but it fixed it <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> drugs <SIL> right <VOCNOISE> yeah so that's what she's interested in right now she's looking to see if she can find someplace to <SIL> work this summer <SIL> even if it's just a day a week <VOCNOISE> some clinic or something just to <SIL> to see whats goes on day to day <IVER>
why's that <IVER>
<NOISE> really <IVER>
