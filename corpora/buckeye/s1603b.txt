from high school and <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> one in that original group of kids that i had <VOCNOISE> never did pass them all <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i guess <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he's not worried because he's gonna work with his dad in his dad's business <SIL> so he's gonna be okay but <VOCNOISE> he never did pass the reading and the writing he passed everything else but <VOCNOISE> and the questions aren't the same <SIL> <CUTOFF-the=there's> i mean there's several different forms every time they send out <SIL> the test it's sealed in a box and <SIL> nobody is allowed to open it but the principal <SIL> and <SIL> then he has to distribute it to the teachers and <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=and> so the questions could change <IVER>
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag <VOCNOISE> or uh how much of a <SIL> uh <SIL> how much do you have to have of the senate <VOCNOISE> to pass a law <SIL> yknow it could be something real real <SIL> technical or something <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> a three year old could answer <SIL> because it's trying to hit <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> all the areas that you've learned <IVER>
i think they're retired teachers or <VOCNOISE> people on maybe the board at different school districts or <SIL> i don't know <VOCNOISE> well <IVER>
course the multiple choice there's a right or wrong answer and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but <SIL> the writing <VOCNOISE> they give you one point for each <SIL> paragraph so you hafta get <SIL> five points to pass <SIL> <SIL> now you might get four out of five and almost pass <SIL> and then you hafta retake that one part <IVER>
<SIL> well yeah that's kind of subjective although <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there is a paper that <SIL> we hand out to our kids that's tells exactly what's supposed to be in every part of this essay <VOCNOISE> like the first the introductory paragraph's supposed to consist of <VOCNOISE> a way to capture the reader's attention <SIL> it's suppose to supply background information <VOCNOISE> it's supposed to state your thesis statement which tells mainly what the <CUTOFF-pa=paper's> paper's gonna be about <VOCNOISE> and then you're supposed to end the introductory paragraph by listing three ideas <SIL> about your thesis <VOCNOISE> that you're going to develop in paragraphs two three and four <VOCNOISE> so i mean it's <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
well most kids what they do is <SIL> they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the <CUTOFF-intr=introduction> <VOCNOISE> most people get ahead of themselves <IVER>
yknow before they <VOCNOISE> tell you <SIL> this was last summer and it was on a vacation to myrtle beach <VOCNOISE> they're telling you about the surfboard that they got <SIL> and how <SIL> great they surfed <VOCNOISE> when that really should come down in the body of the paper <VOCNOISE> yknow most people just <SIL> they assume the reader knows <SIL> i always say to my kids <VOCNOISE> pretend like you're writing for an alien <IVER>
<IVER>
nothing about this planet <IVER>
like i had my kids last week i had them all write <VOCNOISE> how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they didn't know i was gonna do this <VOCNOISE> so after they get <CUTOFF-e=everything?> all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread and my peanut butter and my jelly <VOCNOISE> and i sit them down beside me <VOCNOISE> and i go okay now no ad libbing <SIL> no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote <IVER>
and i do exactly what they said <VOCNOISE> if they say cover the entire piece of bread with peanut butter <VOCNOISE> i cover both sides <IVER>
crust <VOCNOISE> uh the entire piece of bread <VOCNOISE> if they say reach in the <VOCNOISE> bag and grab two pieces of bread i reach in the bag and grab them and by the time i get them out they've got holes in them <VOCNOISE> because to me that's what grab means <IVER>
whereas <SIL> yknow <IVER>
if you just said take <SIL> or get <SIL> i just <SIL> i say well <SIL> i'm just gonna <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because when you get <UNKNOWN-in_that_in_the?> work <SIL> out in the work world <SIL> there's gonna be two things they care about about your writing <SIL> is it useable <SIL> and is it persuasive <SIL> because usually when you're writing something in the workplace <VOCNOISE> it's either to explain something <SIL> or it's to persuade somebody to do something <SIL> so if it's not those two things <SIL> it's not <SIL> it's not writing <SIL> that's gonna make it in the world <SIL> it's i mean <IVER>
oh i have a few kids from time to time that said they want to be writers <VOCNOISE> which yknow they have great ideas but usually <VOCNOISE> they can't <SIL> they can tell you them but when they write it <SIL> my kids <VOCNOISE> usually <VOCNOISE> they leave out words or they <VOCNOISE> leave off a suffix at the end or and the sentence makes no sense <SIL> yknow <SIL> i have to call them up and go <SIL> what does this say <IVER>
or does this say this <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> this is what i thought this said does that what that really says <VOCNOISE> well here's a perfect example the other day <VOCNOISE> my kids <SIL> my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here's the animal i would be and here's why <VOCNOISE> and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it <VOCNOISE> and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and their <VOCNOISE> whether they travel in groups or alone and <VOCNOISE> of what part of the world they mostly habitat <VOCNOISE> what they eat all that <VOCNOISE> okay perfect example <SIL> one of my students wanted to say <VOCNOISE> my animal <SIL> that i picked lives mostly on vegetables <VOCNOISE> and he couldn't figure out how to spell it <VOCNOISE> so he went into the computer and he <SIL> asked it <VOCNOISE> and it gave him the word vestibules <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
said to me that can't be wrong because the computer said <SIL> that was a word <VOCNOISE> i said that is a word <VOCNOISE> come with me i'll show you what a vestibule is <IVER>
so we walked across the street to the church <IVER>
<IVER>
i said there's a big <IVER>
that's a vestibule <SIL> does your animal eat those <SIL> my animal eats mostly vestibules <IVER>
i <LAUGH-see> <LAUGH-I> mean you see <VOCNOISE> the computer <SIL> can't be wrong he said <IVER>
i said well he <CUTOFF-di=didn't> it didn't spell vestibules wrong <VOCNOISE> but i doubt if your animal eats <SIL> parts of buildings <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
perfect yknow or your computer can't tell you that you <VOCNOISE> spelled o n e <SIL> when you meant to spell <SIL> w o n <IVER>
we won we were victorious <VOCNOISE> we didn't one <SIL> <LAUGH> <LAUGH_yknow> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> uh <IVER>
uh <SIL> well a lot of my kids do much better <VOCNOISE> with writing on the computer <VOCNOISE> because they know that <VOCNOISE> they can go back and change it or fix it or they can get spelling help or they can even get grammar help <VOCNOISE> or they can maybe even get <VOCNOISE> syntax help <CUTOFF-i=if> <SIL> if it says this is awkward or something turn the sentence around <VOCNOISE> so my students do a lot better with writing if they do it on the computer <VOCNOISE> than if they are asked to do it <SIL> pencil and paper <SIL> so that's what i make them do their webbing <SIL> you know what a webbing is don't you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> where you <CUTOFF-p=put?> <SIL> web out an idea you <IVER>
and it looks like a spider web <IVER>
i make them do their webbing <SIL> and get their rough draft started <SIL> and then they can go to the computer <SIL> because they i find they um they are a little more creative when they get to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> think about adding pictures and <VOCNOISE> we call it publishing it <SIL> when you get to the publishing stage <IVER>
you should have all your errors corrected <VOCNOISE> even if you <VOCNOISE> have to rewrite it six times i mean <CUTOFF-tha=that> it just blows their mind when i say to them <VOCNOISE> well the other day i wrote a letter to a senator <SIL> and i had to write it six times <SIL> i wrote the letter <SIL> and rewrote it <VOCNOISE> until it was perfect <VOCNOISE> and every time i rewrote it it got better <SIL> and i wrote it six times <SIL> and i'm an english teacher <IVER>
and i tell them writing is not an event <SIL> it's a process <SIL> it's like getting your braces put on <SIL> you go in one time <SIL> and they might pull a couple teeth <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you go in the next time they might put that little wire on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then you go in the next time they might put the lower ones on or part of them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the next time <SIL> then they put on more <VOCNOISE> and then one time <SIL> they'll tighten them a little <VOCNOISE> but it's a process that happens over a period of three years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's not an event <VOCNOISE> they think they can sit down and write <SIL> okay i'm done <SIL> i'm like <LAUGH> <SIL> i don't think so <SIL> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> writing is a <IVER>
<IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well and <IVER>
don't you think <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well i often have to write on papers <VOCNOISE> i believe you turned in the wrong paper <VOCNOISE> i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy <VOCNOISE> do you have the final copy somewhere at home <IVER>
or on your hard drive <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft <SIL> or i'll say to my students have your mom look it over have your sister look it over <VOCNOISE> have somebody else proofread it <VOCNOISE> because you're not gonna see the mistakes because <VOCNOISE> you're too busy thinking about the content <SIL> of what you wanted to say <VOCNOISE> and you're not gonna notice them spelled t h i m <VOCNOISE> or they t h a y <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> or a sentence that's too long <SIL> or a sentence that's a fragment and it isn't a complete thought <SIL> you're not gonna notice that <VOCNOISE> because you know what it was supposed say <VOCNOISE> so give it to a p friend or somebody and let them <VOCNOISE> just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they don't understand <SIL> and that will really help you <SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> well i had a <IVER>
<SIL> i had a student bring me a paper today <VOCNOISE> he said this is for history <VOCNOISE> i have to write an essay on anthony wayne
