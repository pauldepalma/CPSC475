<IVER>
was it what <IVER>
oh <IVER>
sometimes <VOCNOISE> she and mary had more <VOCNOISE> disagreements than i ever had with her <IVER>
she would <VOCNOISE> pamper the kids <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> from where we lived there <CUTOFF-w=was> <VOCNOISE> we lived just <CUTOFF-o=off?> i don't know whether you're acquainted with the north end of columbus but anyway indianola avenue is one of the main thoroughfares <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> we lived about a <VOCNOISE> a block and a half off of indianola <VOCNOISE> and then just <VOCNOISE> another block <VOCNOISE> was a small shopping center <VOCNOISE> where there was a <VOCNOISE> drug store and a <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-sh=?> barber shop and a <VOCNOISE> a ten cent store <VOCNOISE> theater <VOCNOISE> i forget a couple other shops <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> when orrin was <VOCNOISE> about <VOCNOISE> i don't know <CUTOFF-s=six> <VOCNOISE> five five or <CUTOFF-s=six> <VOCNOISE> maybe six or seven years old <VOCNOISE> he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there <VOCNOISE> at all <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> one day <VOCNOISE> grandma gave him <VOCNOISE> i don't know a quarter or something <VOCNOISE> and that burned his pocket till <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or <VOCNOISE> whether he went up <VOCNOISE> on his own but he went up <VOCNOISE> to the store <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether mary went up and got him or what anyway she found out he was up there <VOCNOISE> so <CUTOFF-anyh=anyhow> <VOCNOISE> when i came home she told me what had happened and i said well <VOCNOISE> that just can't be <VOCNOISE> so i took him downstairs and paddled him <VOCNOISE> and i've never been anything more said about it since then <IVER>
the only time i ever did <IVER>
paddle him but uh <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
well i <VOCNOISE> i told him <VOCNOISE> yknow i said <VOCNOISE> something we <SIL> told you you are not to do <IVER>
and you went ahead and did it <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
my parents homesteaded out there <VOCNOISE> in nineteen <VOCNOISE> eleven or twelve shortly after they were married <IVER>
they <VOCNOISE> they'd <VOCNOISE> go out there and there was um <VOCNOISE> i suppose it was a county seat town <VOCNOISE> and they'd file a claim on a certain area <VOCNOISE> of <VOCNOISE> land <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> it was surveyed off and marked off <VOCNOISE> in sections a section of land <VOCNOISE> is uh <VOCNOISE> six hundred and forty acres <VOCNOISE> and that sounds like a lot of <VOCNOISE> it is a good sized area <IVER>
but <LAUGH> when you can't grow much of anything on it it's <IVER>
not that valuable <VOCNOISE> but they <CUTOFF-th=thought> <SIL> that's what they thought though you <VOCNOISE> get it for free well you <VOCNOISE> and then you um <VOCNOISE> you prove up on it as they say you <VOCNOISE> you just <VOCNOISE> build buildings a house and barn and <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> so that you could <VOCNOISE> live on it <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i think i don't know i suppose <SIL> farm a certain amount of what i mean <VOCNOISE> put in wheat or whatever <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> and after five years you get a title to it it's yours <VOCNOISE> so they thought well gee yknow free country free land <VOCNOISE> to a farmer <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> they went out there but <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> dad said in <VOCNOISE> the eleven years that they were out there <VOCNOISE> they only raised <VOCNOISE> three or four crops <IVER>
i mean <VOCNOISE> it's just too dry it <CUTOFF-w=wasn't> <IVER>
it wasn't really farming country <VOCNOISE> and he went <VOCNOISE> he went out there from iowa <VOCNOISE> where you <VOCNOISE> throw a kernel of corn out in the field and <IVER>
a stalk of corn would grow <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> that's how i <VOCNOISE> see uh <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> the <VOCNOISE> only <VOCNOISE> regular crop they had when they were out there my parents <VOCNOISE> was kids <LAUGH> <IVER>
there were six of us born out there <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> my oldest sister <VOCNOISE> started to school out there <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether my <CUTOFF-s=second> uh i don't think <VOCNOISE> my second sister ever went to school out there <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> things were so tough that <VOCNOISE> and mom had <VOCNOISE> taught school in iowa <VOCNOISE> where she grew up <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> got her teacher's certificate <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i guess she and dad agreed that if they could <VOCNOISE> find someone to stay with <VOCNOISE> us kids through the day she could teach <IVER>
so she did <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether it was <VOCNOISE> more than a year or <VOCNOISE> not <VOCNOISE> for <VOCNOISE> i think it was forty dollars a month <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> course that was forty dollars <VOCNOISE> more than they had otherwise <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> then i think <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> let's see she <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> well she went out there when bernice was going to school <VOCNOISE> and bernice went to <VOCNOISE> my oldest sister went to <VOCNOISE> know whether it's first or maybe second grade out there <VOCNOISE> says she <VOCNOISE> she really thought that mom was the best teacher she ever <LAUGH-had_in_grade_school> <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-buzt=but> uh <VOCNOISE> then <VOCNOISE> they hired a girl to come in as a hired girl <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> about the second or third day <VOCNOISE> she was there <VOCNOISE> she wasn't <CUTOFF-feel=feeling> wasn't feeling very good <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> she had smallpox <IVER>
so uh <VOCNOISE> they got us kids <VOCNOISE> vaccinated in time but dad didn't i mean they <IVER>
didn't get vaccinated in time <VOCNOISE> and he was <VOCNOISE> just covered with <VOCNOISE> those sores for i don't know how long <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> mom said that <VOCNOISE> after they started <CUTOFF-cu=?> <VOCNOISE> after the scabs started falling off of him <VOCNOISE> why he'd get out the bed and <VOCNOISE> she'd take the sheet out in the yard and <VOCNOISE> shake it to get those scabs <LAUGH-off> <VOCNOISE> but uh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
the <VOCNOISE> the only uh <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> only people out there other than homesteaders were <VOCNOISE> sheepherders <IVER>
there was this <VOCNOISE> one guy <VOCNOISE> had a <VOCNOISE> so i don't know how many several herds of sheep <VOCNOISE> and he'd hire <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i think they were mexicans <IVER>
as sheepherders <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> they were <VOCNOISE> not <LAUGH-very> <VOCNOISE> desirable specimens other than for <ERROR-heating=herding> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=?> herding sheep <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> we'd come in <VOCNOISE> dirty when <VOCNOISE> mom was the uh <VOCNOISE> dirty as an old sheepherder <LAUGH> <IVER>
and then <VOCNOISE> back of our house <VOCNOISE> about <VOCNOISE> i don't know five hundred yards <VOCNOISE> there's a manmade <VOCNOISE> lake <IVER>
or a small one <VOCNOISE> and i don't know <VOCNOISE> whether it was there when we moved there or not <VOCNOISE> but anyway it was <VOCNOISE> fairly good size i mean <VOCNOISE> probably half mile a mile long and <VOCNOISE> and out in the middle of it <VOCNOISE> there was an island <IVER>
there'd been a small <VOCNOISE> raised place out there <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> what i remember about it is <VOCNOISE> one morning <VOCNOISE> dad went out to milk and <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> milk cows were out on the on that island <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so and <VOCNOISE> i don't know whether he had a boat or anyway there's a boat <ERROR-availiable=available> to him and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> he <CUTOFF-w=?> <VOCNOISE> rowed across the island <IVER>
to milk the cows <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> and then uh <VOCNOISE> one day <VOCNOISE> my two sisters older than i bernice and francis <VOCNOISE> and i were outside playing and <VOCNOISE> bernice i don't know whether bernice or me but one of us said well <CUTOFF-le=let's> <VOCNOISE> let's go down and wade in the lake <IVER>
and that was strictly no no <IVER>
well we started down there and <VOCNOISE> francis the goody two shoes said <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna tell mom <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and she did but we were out <IVER>
bernice had hiked up her <SIL> skirts and i'd rolled up my pants leg and <VOCNOISE> where i was probably not over knee deep <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> i think i was <VOCNOISE> good talking too was all we ever got out of it <IVER>
