<SIL> commitment <SIL> yknow <SIL> can't just be your roommate <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> has to be a long standing kind of thing <VOCNOISE> yeah yknow and that that worries me more than <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-um> <SIL> i <HES-I> <CUTOFF-eh=?> <SIL> understand a lot of the objection is because this is just <SIL> uh <SIL> this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> yknow one legal <SIL> step leads to another legal step and then we'll have gay marriage and all those things but <VOCNOISE> i don't think that would be a bad <NOISE-thing> either <IVER>

<SIL> and and <SIL> no legal sanctions are gonna make any particular difference <VOCNOISE> to the attitude you have going into it <IVER>

would make any difference or not <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
i think so <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think they should be <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think they should be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny <SIL> that <SIL> that um hetero couples are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow with home visits and and economic tests and all these kind of things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <VOCNOISE> the gay people i know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> the ones that would <VOCNOISE> that would want to be parents i think would make great parents <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well one would <CUTOFF-n=?> one would hope that <SIL> there would be enough <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE-word_word> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> education on the subject that the kids wouldn't think it was that odd <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> that <SIL> that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you had two dads <IVER>
<LAUGH-you> were adopted by two <LAUGH-dads> i mean <VOCNOISE> i mean there's <SIL> <CUTOFF-l=lot?> <SIL> a lot uh <CUTOFF-y=??> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-becau=because> <CUTOFF-i=it's?> <SIL> it's it's difficult to adopt children i mean and it and it should be <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so <SIL> the children they would likely <SIL> take would be troubled to begin with <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yknow mixed race <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or or handicapped or <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> hard to place <IVER>
older kids yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh yeah it would be just one more thing <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> one more thing to deal with on the other hand <VOCNOISE> it beats <SIL> beats <SIL> yknow <SIL> growing up in fifty foster homes or an orphanage or <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> getting them some place stable <SIL> <IVER>
with people who want them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
and like i say i don't i don't believe that homosexuality is taught <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> think the kid will grow up and <SIL> discover girls and <SIL> be just fine <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> or grow up and discover boys either <LAUGH-way> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well i <CUTOFF-th=think?> it <SIL> starts with <VOCNOISE> with allowing uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> heather has two mommies <SIL> <IVER>
in the elementary school library <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=?> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we focus on sex so much <VOCNOISE> in our society i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> part of family <CUTOFF-li=life> <UNKNOWN> so uh <SIL> sex is such a small part of family life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh especially with the elementary school kids <SIL> i mean it's just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> is there milk and cookies after school <IVER>
that's the key <LAUGH-thing> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-d=do> yknow do i feel safe is this a place i can go is there somebody <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> who always takes care of me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and and i think left to their own devices <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the younger kids wouldn't think anything about it <SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you got two adults in your house it doesn't matter what gender they are <IVER>
and i think <VOCNOISE> i think if we could <VOCNOISE> yknow if <SIL> if we could just keep that going <SIL> into into <SIL> middle school <SIL> <IVER>
where it's <SIL> where it's not such <SIL> it's <SIL> it's not weird it's just a family <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then when you start to talk about homosexuality it would be easier to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> it would be easier for the kids to <SIL> to see that <SIL> they're just people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i see it as a problem and and if i <SIL> if i <SIL> if i were <VOCNOISE> african american <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i would <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i would not like to see it simply because <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow it it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a <CUTOFF-chi=child> a child not being brought up <SIL> <VOCNOISE> in his <SIL> yknow in his <SIL> tradition <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but on the other hand <VOCNOISE> i'd <SIL> hate to <CUTOFF-s=see> i hate to see <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a child left in foster care <VOCNOISE> or in an orphanage when he could have a home <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> i think ah <VOCNOISE> parents who are willing to <CUTOFF-ado=adopt> <SIL> uh <SIL> going <SIL> willing to adopt <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> a black child or a mixed race child <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or an asian child or any <CUTOFF-ge=?> <VOCNOISE> are gonna are gonna be sensitive to the <SIL> to cultural things because we're just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow it's just the <CUTOFF-w=way> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the way <CUTOFF-th=things> <SIL> things are slanted these days i mean diversity <VOCNOISE> is an issue <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> people who are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> willing to <VOCNOISE> venture out <SIL> into <SIL> uh mixed race adoption <SIL> would <VOCNOISE> <SIL> already be <SIL> way hip
