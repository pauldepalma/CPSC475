<SIL> and <SIL> now it's our turn to deal with the issues <VOCNOISE> we see our parents we see this generation that all these things that are still popular it's that we don't look down on the sixties i mean i <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=think> think the sixties sounded like a pretty fun time to live <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i would get into politics in a second <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> those things are popularized but no we can't do it anymore because we got all these problems <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> aids being one of them <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> politics <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> we grew up <SIL> or came of age <SIL> after the cold war was over <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i'm <SIL> very cynical about this i have a <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-f=fairly> fairly leftist <SIL> uh political <CUTOFF-s=stance> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-s=stance> <VOCNOISE> uh stance <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
which i feel <VOCNOISE> has been <SIL> <CUTOFF-complete=completely> completely devoiced in america because of the effects of the cold war <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i've inherited this world where there was <SIL> of uh <SIL> uh where am i going with this <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i mean the generation before us had <SIL> like vietnam <VOCNOISE> and protested against it <UNKNOWN> i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> and when it came down to it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean the <VOCNOISE> what was the protest really about <SIL> yknow and <VOCNOISE> i'm not being clear so i'm not exactly sure where i'm going with this i very cynical of <SIL> uh about <VOCNOISE> about the world i've inherited <VOCNOISE> uh cause i see a world in which <SIL> my political views <SIL> have been silenced by <SIL> fifty years of <SIL> of <SIL> you know like international politics <SIL> <UNKNOWN> sort of like <SIL> propaganda <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> that says yknow like <VOCNOISE> to be left of a certain point is bad <UNKNOWN> like among conservative circles the word liberal is is like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> almost like calling someone a communist in <SIL> in the forties <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> where as <UNKNOWN> <SIL> i'm very cynical about that cause it <SIL> they feel that <VOCNOISE> it it wasn't <SIL> it it it's been a cultural process that has been developed <VOCNOISE> and now i'm being handed <SIL> this current situation which i <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=see> see is completely unfair <VOCNOISE> i mean i think the reason <SIL> that our generation is <CUTOFF-cyn=cynical> <CUTOFF-cy=cynical> cynical and the reason i'm cynical <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> because <SIL> we're handed a world <SIL> in which <SIL> we see <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the injustices of the past or <SIL> not the <CUTOFF-i=injustices> the the hypocrisy <VOCNOISE> i mean i guess injustice <UNKNOWN> <SIL> also applies in <SIL> terms of things like <SIL> the cold war and stuff but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's why i'm cynical <VOCNOISE> i hope that answers your question at least a little bit <SIL> i don't know <SIL> i feel kinda preachy <LAUGH> like this is my position <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> the technology <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> like living <CUTOFF-i=in> <SIL> in a world where technology puts everything i need at my fingertips <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i mean <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i think that something that would not have happened had there not been <SIL> a uh <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> a highly <SIL> a <SIL> highly populous generation suddenly that <VOCNOISE> was competing and <SIL> within itself <IVER>
mean i <VOCNOISE> some ways i think <VOCNOISE> competition is a bad thing because in our society it's usually not fair <VOCNOISE> someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> i like the fact that we've got this super high tech tape recorder not a big reel to reel thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a <SIL> a computer internet <VOCNOISE> rather than <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are <CUTOFF-h=here> <SIL> that are not in our library and then <VOCNOISE> where do i go from there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i like being able to look oh <VOCNOISE> library of congress has it <SIL> i'll just drive out to washington <SIL> or have them send it here <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> that i think is a major contribution of the past generation <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
civil rights <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> well i i take the <SIL> extreme position <SIL> that civil rights <SIL> are an illusion <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yeah they're on paper <SIL> which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing <SIL> when <SIL> uh there were laws that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender <VOCNOISE> but i think in many ways <VOCNOISE> it has had <VOCNOISE> little <EXT-effect> <SIL> on creating an equal and fair society <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> some my leftist positions will come out right now <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> people have the freedom <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i believe that based upon where <SIL> where in the social stratum where you were born <SIL> in the united states <VOCNOISE> uh you have a <SIL> a limited ability to move <SIL> upward <SIL> and that the these <VOCNOISE-cla-classes> i mean i <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> i don't want to say class lines because that has so many <SIL> like <SIL> historical connotations cause it's <SIL> not the <SIL> exact same as say class was in the marx's sense <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> class lines still today very much <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> follow race lines <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> what good is <SIL> like <SIL> knowing that you have the freedom to vote <SIL> when you know painfully well <SIL> that <SIL> you are not going to be able to get a job that's gonna <SIL> buy a house <VOCNOISE> for your family and let them live in a relative comfort <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=in> in real terms in things i think are <VOCNOISE> valuable to the individual <IVER>
uh civil rights <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ha=has> <SIL> <CUTOFF-w=went> <SIL> only went so far <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they haven't <SIL> corrected the wrongs of the past they haven't <SIL> uh created uh a a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a sense in our <VOCNOISE> society that anyone can achieve like the american dream in in my opinion is an absolute lie <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
and that the <SIL> the <UNKNOWN> the people who <VOCNOISE> whom most face that lie <VOCNOISE> are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so what <SIL> i mean civil rights was an <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-a=an> an important step but once that step was made it was stopped <SIL> and now i believe today there are <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i mean it <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> see a a growing movement of people who want to <VOCNOISE> who <SIL> curtail the advances that were made <SIL> in the sixties <SIL> and it's not our generation who's curtailing it it's still <SIL> the uh <SIL> like <SIL> our <SIL> parents' generation <VOCNOISE> um <NOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
mm <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
ah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it <IVER>
yeah yeah <IVER>
we have definitely made some progress in that direction <SIL> i still think that there is considerable <CUTOFF-progresh=progression> <SIL> progression that needs to be made <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who's a fellow history major <VOCNOISE> her <VOCNOISE> and actually her brother's a <CUTOFF-fellah=fellow> <VOCNOISE> fellow history major too and a friend of mine i don't know him all that well which <SIL> <HES-apparently> her family <SIL> i mean she's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she's double major in history and chemistry <VOCNOISE> she plans to go to med school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> her parents <SIL> her family supports her in this but they've made it painfully clear <SIL> that <SIL> when <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> she shouldn't plan on having a career because <CUTOFF-i=it> she's gonna hafta raise children at some point which is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's not the way things should work in my <VOCNOISE> <SIL> belief uh and and <SIL> the fact that it's like the males telling the daughter <SIL> like <SIL> this is <SIL> how things need to be i think <SIL> i mean <SIL> yknow i think an <HES-individual> <SIL> individual should have the choice <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i feel i mean <CUTOFF-I=I'm> i'm concerned about a <SIL> a uh <SIL> like this push to the right <VOCNOISE> that's sort of going on hoping it's sort of dieing out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four ninety five but uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think uh uh <SIL> we've reached a point <SIL> where <SIL> because not all of the <SIL> advances <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> have <VOCNOISE> been one hundred percent successful <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the the opposition is <SIL> criticizing the advance <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> and <SIL> and trying to stop it <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> uh i'm trying to think of some <SIL> good examples <SIL> i mean <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> when politicians start talking about like biological functions
