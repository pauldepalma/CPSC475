<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> how appaling oh yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> my my family my mom especially is just like when are you gonna stop <VOCNOISE> doing that <VOCNOISE> yeah because he's sixteen months now and <VOCNOISE> i think he's tapering off quite a bit so <VOCNOISE> i think that he'll be done soon but i'm not pushing him so <IVER>
i think so <SIL> he's he's not being forced to go in any direction that he's not ready for <SIL> yeah i was going to college and <VOCNOISE> and going to work and <SIL> i mean i think that their personalities are different too though <SIL> so he was very independent but i'm not sure that that's just <SIL> his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put being put and <SIL> being in daycare from a very very young age and <SIL> and then <SIL> yknow my youngest he's never been in daycare at all <SIL> so <IVER>
it just <SIL> just kind of <SIL> instincts i <LAUGH-guess> <SIL> yeah actually there are <SIL> quite a there's an <VOCNOISE> an a well pretty well known doctor that has a ton of books and <SIL> i go to la leche league and <SIL> that's kind of their philosophy in a way <SIL> yeah <SIL> just that breast feeding is yknow a way to mother <SIL> and nurture and feed and yknow it <SIL> it meets all of these needs it's kind of like <SIL> it's just <SIL> yeah <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> oh i believe it <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> well one of my la leche league leaders she has a p h d <VOCNOISE> and she does a lot of reading <SIL> and she said that she actually read a study <VOCNOISE> that they did um for breast fed babies to bottle fed babies <SIL> and they said the difference in their i q <SIL> is equivalent to uh <SIL> a regular <SIL> bottle fed baby <SIL> and a baby exposed to lead poisoning <VOCNOISE> it's that much higher even <CUTOFF-clipping=so> so i mean it's just given them that much of uh <VOCNOISE> better <SIL> head start <SIL> on development <SIL> so <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
