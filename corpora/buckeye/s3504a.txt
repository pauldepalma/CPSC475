<IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and he did that too <SIL> uh <IVER>
no and he <IVER>
yknow he had he had <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he <VOCNOISE> was living with this one family for a while <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they were nudists and taking him to nudist camps and stuff like this <UNKNOWN-and_I_thought> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-wa=what> <SIL> what do you think they would <VOCNOISE> they never had any contact with us they just let him move in <VOCNOISE> can you imagine letting your <SIL> fourteen year <EXT-olds> friend just <SIL> move in <SIL> and not <SIL> find out why or <LAUGH-anything> <IVER>
i just <VOCNOISE> he uh he did <VOCNOISE> talk to one of his friends who <SIL> he wasn't really a <CUTOFF-w=?> did <CUTOFF-wa=?> didn't really know that <SIL> this friends mother and i grew up together <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh so he was <SIL> he <SIL> asked if he could move into their house and the mother said there were three things <SIL> one i need something in writing from your parents <VOCNOISE> two i need to talk to your parents <VOCNOISE> and three there are rules you'll have to obey <IVER>
of course that never happened <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i think he really does <IVER>
uh yknow he's paying rent at his mother in law <SIL> <HES-as> wasn't not really his mother in law but in her <VOCNOISE> so she can <VOCNOISE> <SIL> right <SIL> uh <SIL> he's he has become more responsible <SIL> but responsible about a lot of things <VOCNOISE> which is again <SIL> <CUTOFF-n=normal> <SIL> at normal maturation <VOCNOISE> and he's just doing it the hard way <IVER>
he was <SIL> yknow pretty much promised a free ride through o s u's music program <VOCNOISE> and he turned that <VOCNOISE> and he's thrown that away <SIL> and i <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i don't even know if he regrets that <SIL> i really have no idea <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he just doesn't want talk to us about things like that <VOCNOISE> he does talk to <VOCNOISE> his girlfriend about it and she's become very close with my wife <VOCNOISE> she's <SIL> never had an adult <SIL> really the <VOCNOISE> um a mentor of any kind even <VOCNOISE> my <CUTOFF-wi=wife> she wants to go to <SIL> school my wife's <VOCNOISE> agreed to go with her when she goes for the interviews and stuff <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=she> <SIL> she says she doesn't know what to ask or anything and <IVER>
course my wife's worked in higher education for thirty years so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and she wants go to columbus state <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh wants to get into <VOCNOISE> one of their engineering tech programs <SIL> um <SIL> um hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i i hope she does <SIL> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-ca=because> she <CUTOFF-be=because> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she never fit in in high school she is very bright <SIL> she's <VOCNOISE> mature in <CUTOFF-so=some> many ways but she's had to be responsible for herself her whole life <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but she was never interested in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and never really interested in boys or in sports in high school <SIL> or uh <SIL> make up <SIL> and clothes and things like that and <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-yo=you're> <VOCNOISE> you're setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that <VOCNOISE> and that's what happened she'd come home in tears because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally <SIL> she just stopped going <SIL> and within a couple months <SIL> she got her g e d <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> may be kind of hard in a <SIL> when she gets into a <SIL> engineering tech program because she hasn't had all a the <SIL> math prerequisites <SIL> because she just didn't stay in school long enough <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i <IVER>
i think she yeah she will <IVER>
and <CUTOFF-she=she's> and she's very determined <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she has said that <SIL> <CUTOFF-ha=had> <VOCNOISE> having this being pregnant having this baby has made her focus on things a lot differently <VOCNOISE> she <CUTOFF-doe=doesn't> she doesn't wanna go back to being the way she was before she doesn't want go back to the <VOCNOISE> the drugs and the smoking and the drinking <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-hu=well> <CUTOFF-everyth=everything> uh <CUTOFF-th=the> all focus changes it really does <IVER>
and it never goes back to the way it was before did you just know that there's someone that's completely dependent on you for <SIL> everything <IVER>
everything you do <SIL> right <IVER>
right <IVER>
and she's taken very good care of herself she followed all the doctor's <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> orders and <SIL> she's very careful what she eats and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and they've met the couple that's gonna adopt the baby <SIL> which <SIL> seems kind of odd to me but <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh right and <CUTOFF-th=they> they were actually able to select the couple from a they talked to <HES-a> a lawyer who arranges adoptions <SIL> and she had a file and they <VOCNOISE> yknow threw kind of a bunch of questions and answers type thing were to limit to <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=three> down to three couples and they liked the first couple <SIL> they met <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
but uh you know with people <SIL> coming back later and saying that <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> they <ERROR-di=did> changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents i'd be concerned about that but <VOCNOISE> that's not gonna happen in this case i don't <SIL> think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the <SIL> because of her age and this makes no sense to me <VOCNOISE> the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for seventy two hours <SIL> before she can give it up for adoption <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> because of her age and it <SIL> doesn't make any sense to me but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so the yknow they're <SIL> talking to a social worker now to find out they don't want take the baby home <SIL> because they're afraid of being too attached to it then <VOCNOISE> and they don't think it's a good <HES-atmosphere> for it <SIL> because her mother smokes constantly her mother's alcoholic <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> they <IVER>
<NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <IVER>
<SIL> uh so she does not want <SIL> to take the baby home so they're <SIL> arranging some other things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we have actually talked about taking the baby home ourselves for that time but we think that's gonna be too hard for us <IVER>
we even talked about adopting the baby <VOCNOISE> but at our age <IVER>
that's <SIL> i mean we'd be seventy years old when the kid graduates from high school <VOCNOISE> uh and that wouldn't be fair to the kid <SIL> <CUTOFF-an=and> and we were doing it for the wrong reasons too so <SIL> we talked about it decided it wasn't a good idea <IVER>
i'm not sure i'm ready to go back through <LAUGH-all_that> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> as much fun as it was the first time <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> i just not <IVER>
ready willing to do that again <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it's a great experience it really <CUTOFF-i=it> <CUTOFF-wa=was> <CUTOFF-i=it> <CUTOFF-wa=was> <SIL> even when <SIL> yknow we were having problems with him and stuff it was great <SIL> uh he couldn't understand <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> my wife's once said told him she says yknow <VOCNOISE> something about spending time together <SIL> she <SIL> she said that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there is no time that we spend with you that's wasted <VOCNOISE> and he couldn't understand that <VOCNOISE> she said you mean this is fun i said i didn't say it was fun <LAUGH> <LAUGH-ju=just> <IVER>
it's just not <LAUGH-wasted> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't <SIL> think he really understood that he might someday but <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and i really think both of them will be good parents someday <VOCNOISE> but she says <SIL> we're not ready <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> she's <CUTOFF-be=been> <IVER>
she's been very mature about it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and she has <SIL> they are working on an arrangement with the <IVER>
uh <SIL> couple that are adopting baby will get <SIL> counseling for her <IVER>
afterwards too and that's one things they've asked for in the <SIL> adoption agreement <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and the <VOCNOISE> couple's <SIL> willing to do that <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <SIL> and yknow <CUTOFF-th=the> <VOCNOISE> while the baby's in the hospital be covered under my son's insurance and she's covered under her father's insurance so <VOCNOISE> their medical expenses are not gonna be very big <IVER>
so <IVER>
