<SIL> and socially too <SIL> i mean mostly a d h <SIL> d and l d kids are emotionally immature as well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so like the songs that their friends are listening to <SIL> and their friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they're still <SIL> acting like a fifth grader <VOCNOISE> yknow their not interested in girls and they're still listening to music that younger kids would like <VOCNOISE> they're just <SIL> generally <SIL> they mature a little slower <SIL> takes them longer to catch up <IVER>
attention deficit hyperactive disorder <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well <IVER>
actually <SIL> you can have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well they <CUTOFF-m=mainly?> usually go together some kids have learning disabilities without the <SIL> a d h d and some have <SIL> a d h d without the learning disability <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and some have both <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you can have a d <SIL> d without having the hyperactive part <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you can have <SIL> attention deficit disorder <VOCNOISE> with what they call hypo activity <VOCNOISE> and that's the student <VOCNOISE> that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they never cause any trouble <VOCNOISE> but they're kind of like out of touch with reality and they are always looking out the window <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and like they're the one that says i didn't hear what what was the question <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <SIL> they're <SIL> they're a d d and they can't quite focus and <CUTOFF-sh=?> distract <SIL> <CUTOFF-ne=?> they can't screen out the distractions but <VOCNOISE> because they're not hyper they're not always doing this and they're not bothering people <VOCNOISE> they're kind of the <VOCNOISE> they're the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle <SIL> those are the kids that are real cooperative and they're always smiling they're kind of spaced out and daydreaming and <SIL> and takes a long time to realize <SIL> hey this kid <SIL> can't focus <VOCNOISE> but with the kid that's all over the place and doing a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> tapping this kids chair and the kid goes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> make him stop tapping my chair <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-yi=you> you can see right away that he can't focus because when you're he asks you for help and you come over to explain something to him and he's like <SIL> all over the place while you're explaining he's not listening <NOISE-you're> trying to show him something he won't look at it <VOCNOISE> yknow it's like <SIL> people often say <SIL> a d d kids <SIL> can't focus <SIL> or can't <SIL> attend to anything <SIL> but what's really happening <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is they attend to everything <IVER>
they can <IVER>
they just can't <SIL> single out <SIL> what i should attend to and what i should screen out <VOCNOISE> so they attend to everything <ERROR-we=equally> equally <VOCNOISE> the train going by out here the teacher talking up here <VOCNOISE> the kid over here shuffling his papers <VOCNOISE> this kid back <NOISE-here> <NOISE-picking> up his pencil <VOCNOISE> and so <SIL> they get a little bit of everything and they don't learn anything <IVER>
<SIL> you see <SIL> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
or um <IVER>
if you read it <SIL> to yourself out loud <SIL> like if you're in a room by yourself and you read out loud do you remember it better <SIL> than if you read <NOISE-it> silently <SIL> if you hear yourself say the words <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well you have to um <SIL> try some different things like put on headphones with music that doesn't have any words <SIL> and try to read somewhere like <IVER>
yeah <SIL> that blocks out <SIL> all that uh <CUTOFF-s=sound?> <VOCNOISE> extraneous stuff that's trying to pull you away <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah and you don't want to listen to any <CUTOFF-m=music> music with words because then you'll start singing in the words and then you won't be able to read <IVER>
now how can you do that <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
and i have kids that say i do better when i listen to my music honest i do misses <EXCLUDE-name> please let me listen to my headphones <VOCNOISE> but then they can't hear you when you say okay the time's up stop now or whatever <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're going <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> poke him <LAUGH> so i don't usually let the kids listen to their headphones oh maybe the last week of school in june or something but <VOCNOISE> or maybe right around christmas time but most of the time i don't <VOCNOISE> because they get <SIL> too <SIL> out of touch with everything that's going on in the room <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i don't have a like a regular size class like i'll have five six seven kids at a time and believe me when you got seven hyper active <IVER>
<IVER>
in your room <VOCNOISE> it's just like forty of any other kind it's plenty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh there always has been <VOCNOISE> there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a lot of kids are on medication today that shouldn't be <SIL> but um <SIL> i think that's the fault of the school or the parents <VOCNOISE> or some doctor that like for example when we <ERROR-frefer=refer> kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with <VOCNOISE> and we know that they won't just give this kid a pill if he doesn't have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> eight out of the twelve symptoms or whatever <SIL> so we refer them to those doctors and then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if <SIL> this <CUTOFF-do=doctor> <VOCNOISE> those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it's usually just for the school day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not during the summer not over vacation not after five o'clock <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not on the weekends <VOCNOISE> and it's just to help them focus <SIL> and then <SIL> these doctors also ask for <VOCNOISE> reports back from the teachers and if you don't see any appreciable difference <VOCNOISE> in two or three weeks then you take the kid off and you try something else <VOCNOISE> and some kids medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in observe the kid you can't believe it's the same kid <VOCNOISE> other kids <SIL> doesn't phase them they might as well be drinking a glass of water <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well <SIL> since they have side effects like they stunt your growth and they <VOCNOISE> subdue your appetite and some of the other <SIL> yknow some kids get headaches from dexadrine and aderal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i say yknow if it works use it if it <SIL> if it doesn't work just forget it <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> yknow a lot of <SIL> people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there may be just <SIL> not able to pay attention a little bit but they're not really a d d <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the parents are taking them in and going <VOCNOISE> johnnie's not getting straight a's put him on something <LAUGH> <LAUGH> so <SIL> i guess <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <CUTOFF-an=and> <IVER>
i think <VOCNOISE> it's really <SIL> you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on <VOCNOISE> and how long they stay on it <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and most kids don't like being on medication <VOCNOISE> because it makes them different <VOCNOISE> they don't look at it like <SIL> gee i'm really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate <VOCNOISE> they look it like <VOCNOISE> well none of my friends have to do it so why do i have to do it <VOCNOISE> yknow <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> they look at it like it's a big pain because they gotta run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> generally <SIL> the long acting they're time released ones there's only a couple of them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release <VOCNOISE> and they only work for about forty percent of the population most people try the time release <VOCNOISE> and it wears off and it doesn't <SIL> do what it's supposed to so they go back to <VOCNOISE> the six hour <SIL> dosage yknow one in the morning one at lunch <VOCNOISE> and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they're late to the lunch line and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they just hate it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but it isn't something they can <VOCNOISE> a lot of kids <SIL> will not <SIL> i guess they're in <SIL> denial just like <SIL> we would be <SIL> they say <SIL> it doesn't help me i don't need it <VOCNOISE> but when you sit down and say okay <VOCNOISE> what are the things you're able to do when you're on it <SIL> <SIL> that you really have trouble with when you're off of it and they see it in black and white they go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh yeah <IVER>
<SIL> i did get better grades last nine weeks didn't i <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> wow isn't that amazing you were taking your pills then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some connection here <LAUGH> so you kind of just have to sit them down and and say well let's just go through some of the things that <VOCNOISE> give you trouble and we'll write them down and say <SIL> oh well last nine weeks you did that without any problem at all <SIL> <VOCNOISE> this nine weeks <VOCNOISE> you haven't been able to focus on that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> maybe <VOCNOISE-the-medicine> does help you some <SIL> maybe you just <SIL> yknow not giving it credit <IVER>
by the eighth grade they are <SIL> sixth and seventh graders pretty much know everything <SIL> and you're the stupid one <SIL> but by the time they get to eighth grade they're going <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh you're the best teacher i can't believe i said that to you <LAUGH> <IVER>
or they <SIL> yeah <SIL> they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school <IVER>
three years <SIL> i have them <VOCNOISE> usually i have them sixth seventh and eighth <SIL> for those <SIL> language arts subjects <SIL> unless they get <SIL> some miraculous cure <SIL> and they get <SIL> phased out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like right now i'm phasing a kid an eighth grader out and into the regular english <VOCNOISE> but he worked really really hard <SIL> and he's very bright <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he's still a terrible speller <SIL> but <SIL> he <SIL> is not lazy <SIL> and he does his assignments <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and as long as you clearly <SIL> explain to him what he's supposed to do and he's a good writer <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <CUTOFF-r=?> usually when he misspells something you can figure out what it says from the context <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow so we're in the process of phasing him out <SIL> so that he won't have to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's had help <SIL> i think since he was in kindergarten <SIL> that's the other thing that's really an enigma about these kids <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ninety percent of the time their i q is like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i mean they're very bright <SIL> but yet <SIL> something <SIL> isn't <SIL> <IVER>
connecting <SIL> some wires are crossed up here or something <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they're <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=and?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=and?> so they become very distrustful of adults because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all their life people've been saying <SIL>
