<SIL> yeah <SIL> it was because i got <SIL> it was because i got into a different <SIL> i mean <SIL> i had grown up <SIL> with these people <SIL> yknow i hung out with all these people that were part of my youth group and <SIL> and i hung out with them and hung out with them and <SIL> and <SIL> i came to columbus and met a whole new group of people <SIL> mean every year i've been down here i've met another <SIL> yknow <SIL> thousand people <SIL> and they're all different <SIL> every year they're <SIL> all different people <SIL> and that didn't happen back home i keep meeting people and it's just really fascinating <SIL> yeah <SIL> this is <SIL> endless flow of people and you're like wow <SIL> and man there get some weird looking people down here <SIL> man there's some good looking chicks down here in columbus <SIL> let me tell you <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> um yeah my freshman year i went out with uh someone her name was <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> she <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she's the one who really got me into the uh <SIL> what we call charismatic <SIL> um <SIL> christianity <SIL> the christianity uh <SIL> yknow like <SIL> the opposite of charismatic <SIL> is <SIL> the um the serious <SIL> old time protestant church <SIL> where they put numbers up on the wall and you open up your hymnal to those numbers you sing <SIL> you stand up when everyone tells you stand up you sit down when everyone tells you to sit down <SIL> yadda yadda <SIL> and then <SIL> the <VOCNOISE> protestant <SIL> the uh sorry the um <SIL> charismatic is the exact opposite of that <SIL> when you think of charismatic you think of the black churches <SIL> where there's <SIL> all sorts of <SIL> organ playing and <SIL> yknow praise the <EXCLUDE-praise_the_Lord> and hands in the air and singing and dancing and <SIL> people falling over and <SIL> and she's she really introduced me to that <SIL> um <SIL> and then we dated for about three months <SIL> and <SIL> i <SIL> both of us decided okay <SIL> this is <SIL> we accomplished what we <VOCNOISE> were supposed to accomplish in this relationship you've introduced me to something and i've introduced you to something and <SIL> now we're gonna go our separate ways and so <VOCNOISE> we separated <SIL> and then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i found my current church <SIL> and <SIL> got plugged in there and i met someone there <SIL> um <SIL> in <SIL> january <SIL> of this year <SIL> we dated for two months <SIL> and then <SIL> i got really tired of the fact that within two weeks of knowing me and dating me she said <SIL> <EXCLUDE-oh> william you're the person i'm gonna marry <SIL> and that <IVER>
flipped me out <IVER>
<SIL> that flipped me out man <SIL> i couldn't handle that that <SIL> i'm not ready for that i mean that was crazy she was twenty three first person i've ever dated that's older than me <SIL> and uh that was just frightening i mean she was like <SIL> dead serious she was a hundred percent sure <SIL> i was the person she was going to marry <SIL> and i'll see her at church every so often and she'll come up and give me a big hug she's like i miss you <SIL> i'm like <SIL> well i miss you too not probably the way you miss me but i miss <SIL> i miss you yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um yeah if she's a <ERROR-nunatic> no <LAUGH> no no no no no i mean she's a <CUTOFF-g=great> she's a great person she's a good christian but there's some things about her that i would not want in a wife <LAUGH> <SIL> ixnay on that <SIL> but um <SIL> i've been single since <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> probably <SIL> march <SIL> and i'm probably gonna stay that way for a while mainly because i don't like anybody nobody likes me i like it that way <SIL> i don't <IVER>
i don't have money and <SIL> when i start dating people i have <ERROR-expre=extremely> <SIL> i have extremely expensive tastes <VOCNOISE> for women <SIL> and <SIL> i like wine and dining people <VOCNOISE> i love the opera <SIL> and that gets real <EXCLUDE-expensive_after> a while <SIL> gets real expensive after a while <SIL> uh i'm taking one class <SIL> i'm taking uh an accounting class <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> i had a real big mess <SIL> academically <SIL> um <SIL> graduated high school with three five it was all college prep classes a p courses <SIL> i got a really high i q extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coasting on that intellect <SIL> i'd go in take an exam <SIL> bing bang <SIL> go out get an a <SIL> wouldn't even study for it i think i studied as much my senior year as i did my <SIL> freshman year for one midterm <LAUGH> or <LAUGH> or one final <SIL> and uh that just didn't work when i got to college <SIL> but i didn't know that until i was done with my freshman year with a one point seven g p a <SIL> about uh <SIL> about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-whe=when> see the middle of winter quarter i realized why <SIL> i was in engineering <SIL> i had applied <EXCLUDE-to> <SIL> three colleges <SIL> my senior year of high school <SIL> ohio state <SIL> on a whim from my dad who told me to apply there because <SIL> i could get in <SIL> without any trouble whatsoever <SIL> naval academy and the air force academy <SIL> now <SIL> naval academy air force academy and west point <SIL> are three of the top <CUTOFF-har=hardest> <SIL> ten hardest schools in the world to get into <SIL> you get into one of those academies and you're coming out as an engineer <SIL> that's what they all are <SIL> i mean yeah there's other <SIL> there's other field but the vast majority are engineers <SIL> i like math and science <SIL> so i figure oh <SIL> engineering i don't have any other options i must be engineering <SIL> so i came to college and i got into the <SIL> honors engineering <SIL> freshman freshman <ERROR-honginineer=honors_engineer> <SIL> honors <SIL> engineering program <SIL> called the gateway program <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> engineering <SIL> is the <SIL> hardest <SIL> field <SIL> to study <SIL> aside probably from law or medicine <SIL> and <SIL> i went into the <SIL> honors program <SIL> that was a big mistake <SIL> really really big mistake i got to college and it just went downhill <SIL> i had all that freedom and <SIL> i had no clue how to study <SIL> and it just went to hell in a hand basket <SIL> summer <SIL> um <CUTOFF-s=summer?> spring quarter <SIL> i switched my major to music <SIL> because i'm extremely musically inclined it's one of the gifts that i've gotten <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that uh <SIL> that i discovered is very similar to acting which i love to do but i realized that just like acting <SIL> you <SIL> are <SIL> all good <SIL> ninety five percent of you are poor as dirt <SIL> three percent of you <SIL> are right in the middle and two percent of you are extremely wealthy <SIL> and the vast majority like i said ninety five percent are dirt poor yknow i don't want to do that <SIL> i mean i <SIL> i my dad's a doctor i was raised in high society i don't want to leave high society <VOCNOISE> i like it there <LAUGH> <SIL> i like it there a lot <SIL> yeah <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i was like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i better get out of <VOCNOISE> better get out of the music thing <SIL> so i decided to go into business <SIL> but um <SIL> i can't get into business <SIL> until <SIL> i get a <ERROR-punch=bunch> a bunch prerequisite courses <VOCNOISE> out of the way because my g p a is <CUTOFF-on=only> <SIL> it's <SIL> i <SIL> in <SIL> after <CUTOFF-l=last?> <SIL> this quarter i did really good this quarter <SIL> after this quarter it's up to a two two <SIL> and <SIL> i'm not gonna be able to <SIL> get into the business school until i've got a bunch prerequisites out of the way <SIL> and they're sequences <SIL> i can't take accounting two twelve until i'm done with two eleven i can't take <SIL> c i s two hundred and two o one until i'm done with two hundred <SIL> and all that <SIL> junk so <SIL> i had to take this stupid class this summer because <SIL> if i'm gonna get in when i want to <SIL> um <SIL> i have <SIL> yknow i hafta take it this summer <SIL> i hate taking classes in summer <SIL> when i'm <SIL> well because <SIL> i'd rather just <SIL> i'd rather just <SIL> work <SIL> and and not worry about the classes and then have all sorts of fun all summer long with all my friends <SIL> but it's not gonna work <SIL> yeah <SIL> rest my brain a little bit <SIL> but i'm still searching for a job <SIL> it's not that i can't find jobs it's just that i can't find the one i want <SIL> i mean the job market is huge down here in columbus <SIL> i mean i want a job right around nine ten dollars an hour <SIL> so i can get a full forty hour week <SIL> and they won't have a problem with me leaving at five o'clock because i have a class at five thirty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but that's what i'm doing this summer <SIL> i'm still searching for a job <SIL> i would've <SIL> i would've done some more searching today but i've had a few problems with my satanic computer <SIL> stupid <IVER>
<SIL> i swear it's possessed <SIL> i <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> if i could figure out how to work <SIL> f disk <SIL> and format <SIL> in dos <SIL> i might be able to figure out what my problem is <SIL> because i've started running two <SIL> i started running windows two thousand <SIL> about three months ago <SIL> that was a dumb mistake <SIL> one of the guys in my house is software <ERROR-prirate=pirate> <SIL> and he got me a copy of two thousand he was like <SIL> <EXCLUDE-dude> your computer will run two thousand let's put it on your computer so i was <IVER>
<SIL> i was like <SIL> okay <SIL> alright what are the advantages and he's like dude let's just put on your computer so i'm like alright fine <SIL> i don't care <SIL> so we put it on my computer and i've had nothing but problems since <SIL> i don't know how anyone can run two thousand if they don't know what they're doing i'm trying to find drivers <SIL> because i've had to find <SIL> i've had to find <SIL> drivers for everything <SIL> i mean they don't <UNKNOWN> <SIL> oh yeah <SIL> and also it's <VOCNOISE> directed towards businesses <SIL> it's <SIL> n t technology which is <SIL> <ERROR-divisigned=divised_designed> for network businesses and <SIL> well anyways <SIL> it's got a different file structure format than windows ninety <SIL> eight <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> it runs <SIL> it runs on <SIL> n t s f <SIL> and fat thirty two <SIL> and <SIL> i hafta switch it back <SIL> to fat sixteen <SIL> and <SIL> i can't get the partitioning right <SIL> for my <CUTOFF-d=drive> <SIL> for my drive because fat sixteen can't handle anything above two gigs for the primary drive <SIL> and my drive is ten gig drive so i hafta partition it <SIL> and i can't figure out how to get silly thing partitioned <SIL> because every time i try and work around it and make partition through f disk <SIL> i get these really wacky <SIL> errors <SIL> everything gets transferred over to d drive and i have no more c drive <SIL> it's gone <LAUGH> <SIL> i don't know where it vanishes to <SIL> so <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it> it is <SIL> no and i can't do a stinking thing on my computer <SIL> i hafta use all the other guys' computers in my house
