hum-um <IVER>
i had considered that yes <IVER>
i just <VOCNOISE> actually i was going to send my son to a <HES-christian> kindergarten but i decided to home school instead so i've been home schooling him for kindergarten <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> because i want his morals and <CUTOFF-hi-=his> yknow <SIL> his <VOCNOISE> basic stuff to come from me <SIL> really <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> exactly i wish i would have taken typing and home ec in high school <VOCNOISE> and i was too busy with college prep and <VOCNOISE> yknow what good did that do me <LAUGH> <IVER>
i <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> life skills <LAUGH> <IVER>
exactly <LAUGH-huge> <IVER>
everybody needs to know that <NOISE> information <VOCNOISE> for credit cards <IVER>
yeah my husband was one of those <IVER>
we're still working those <LAUGH-problems-out> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
and it stays with you for years <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> they don't realize that nobody tells them until after the <LAUGH-fact> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> i have no idea <LAUGH> <LAUGH> <IVER>
i i <HES-word> knew that kindergarten because it's <SIL> it's not required in the state of ohio <SIL> anyway they really aren't required to be <VOCNOISE> in school or enrolled in anything until they're six by september <VOCNOISE> when i found that out <EXCLUDE-I> was like oh ok cool <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-y-=you> can keep them home i mean he's <VOCNOISE> he could probably go into the second grade i mean <SIL> he's <SIL> very bright he can read and write and <VOCNOISE> add and <HES-_he> he yknow he's <SIL> so it's a challenge for me <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah <LAUGH> oh yeah <SIL> we're crazy <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he's an educator which is all the more reason to <LAUGH-home-school> <VOCNOISE> because he sees it and he's like <SIL> yeah they <IVER>
get it from us so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i know <VOCNOISE> exactly <SIL> right <VOCNOISE> i've seen some of the work from my husband's ninth and tenth graders because he's an english teacher <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i was appalled <SIL> because they were writing at like a fourth or fifth grade level and they're ninth and tenth graders <VOCNOISE> and i mean <CUTOFF-di=did?> <SIL> just <SIL> yknow even their manuscript and yknow just how they wrote and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-I> was like wow <LAUGH> i couldn't believe it <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> doesn't <VOCNOISE> that's a bunch of <CUTOFF-m=malarky?> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's just one of those myths <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i think that's <SIL> to make people feel guilty or something <IVER>
but it's not gonna work <VOCNOISE> i mean they <SIL> if you're around <SIL> people i mean number one they're around <VOCNOISE> their parents and their siblings and that's socialization <VOCNOISE> you go to <SIL> church or to the library or wherever i mean you're around people and you're around <SIL> children and they get to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> have socialization if you want to call it <SIL> whatever <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> from everything that i've read and seen <VOCNOISE> that um <SIL> they get <SIL> the socialization that they need at home and they're not relying so much on their peers and their peer's opinions <VOCNOISE> because <HES-I> <HES-I> for one example the pokemon craze <VOCNOISE> my son didn't know what pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it <VOCNOISE> and yknow it's just like stuff like that <VOCNOISE> it's just like they don't <SIL> they don't know what <VOCNOISE> half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face yknow <VOCNOISE> and then even still they're just like oh it's cool because everybody else likes it they don't really know what <SIL> it is or what <SIL> it's about or <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> <LAUGH> yknow what i mean because it's like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now they just blow up each other or whatever it's like really what is the point to the whole thing and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he didn't know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about it oh it must be cool because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it wasn't cool <VOCNOISE> so that was my <CUTOFF-influ=influence> our influence on him rather than the peer's influence on him <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> exactly <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> yeah <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it is and it's not <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> my house isn't as clean as i would like it to be but <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> but that's just one <VOCNOISE> minor <SIL> minor thing <VOCNOISE> and i feel like i'm just in a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> kind of a <HES-phase> phase if you will <VOCNOISE> it's yknow because they'll be grown up <SIL> in a blink of an eye <VOCNOISE> so if i <VOCNOISE> i mean if i put my career or whatever on hold <VOCNOISE> it's gonna be worth it in the long run <SIL> when my kids <SIL> are grown up <NOISE> <SIL> and they could be like yeah mom was there <VOCNOISE> they taught <SIL> yknow mom and dad taught us <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all of our life application skills that we need to know now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think that <SIL> that'll be better in the long run for them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that's the responsibility i took on as being a parent so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's my job <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> even though it is mundane and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> monotonous at <LAUGH-times> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <NOISE> <SIL> exactly <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> exactly <VOCNOISE> that's the that's the idea that people get they don't <SIL> i don't think they realize <VOCNOISE> that how much <LAUGH-work> it is <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah and it's a challenge living on one income <SIL> <LAUGH> that's why i've got a part time job now <LAUGH> <IVER>
