<VOCNOISE> and the <VOCNOISE> um that was <SIL> part of the process there to how to work work and work <SIL> up there too with people <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> if we could just share more <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

oh yeah <SIL> there's always people out there <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> actually i wore out <IVER>
i sort of wore out <SIL> um <SIL> that <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> just <SIL> oh there were two reasons i left one i was getting <SIL> exhausted <SIL> and uh <SIL> it was just <SIL> so demanding <SIL> and <SIL> we didn't know as a community how to let <CUTOFF-o=off> <SIL> uh up <SIL> <LAUGH-so_I_had_to> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-had_to> <SIL> i had to withdraw <SIL> another thing was <SIL> i'm very into um <SIL> metaphysics <SIL> and studying and meditating we had no time whatsoever everybody was <VOCNOISE> in there <SIL> um <SIL> that's one disagreement i have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in january so there's always people <SIL> coming for <SIL> four <SIL> or five days <SIL> and you have <LAUGH-to_explain_everything_in_life_to_them_in_four_or_five_days> <SIL> and plus we <SIL> uh lived in um <SIL> a <SIL> a rural setting where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant <SIL> and a hardware and had a mail route <SIL> and then we had all these visitors and then we and then we <SIL> uh made our own bread and we <SIL> uh <SIL> milked a cow <LAUGH-and_uh> <LAUGH> so it's just <CUTOFF-p=plain> plain <SIL> hard physical work <SIL> plus all the mental <SIL> um stuff of dealing with people's really big questions <SIL> it <CUTOFF-wa=was> <SIL> it was <LAUGH-intense> <LAUGH> yknow so that's the reason i had to quit is was <SIL> like <SIL> if i could <SIL> leave this situation for a month or six weeks <SIL> and get caught up within myself <SIL> i would have been okay but <SIL> that wasn't how it worked <SIL> so had to <SIL> to pull back from it <LAUGH> <IVER>
