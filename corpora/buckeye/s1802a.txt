i love kittens and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow i <VOCNOISE> but i'm gonna wait <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> we're not sure um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we're looking to <SIL> uh we rent now and we're looking to buy house <IVER>
probably <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> northwest area <IVER>
actually <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i live in clintonville now and it's real convenient but <VOCNOISE> the houses are so old and <SIL> i'm just tired of living in an old <LAUGH-house> <IVER>
they're nice but <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-huh <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
that's perfect <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
see that's how my husband was they didn't have a pet growing up <IVER>
and i just can't imagine i had dogs and cats <VOCNOISE> we did and i loved it <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> i just think kids need that and it's just <SIL> a different kind of love i think <SIL> yknow they learn from it and <SIL> <IVER>
you look forward to coming home yknow and the pets waiting <LAUGH-on <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
hm <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
hm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's great <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh is he <IVER>
well my husband was allergic when <SIL> we first got together but i hafta admit <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> it's <SIL> it's <SIL> they well he went <SIL> he goes to <CUTOFF> <SIL> he has other allergies <SIL> um <SIL> so he gets shots and things but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow they always say it's the pet dander <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh eventually he <SIL> he was alright with it <VOCNOISE> he got used to it <IVER>
um <SIL> i've always heard and i'm <VOCNOISE> i'm very clean anyways but yknow when you hafta vacuum a lot and everything and you're constantly picking up that dander rather than just let it sit and accumulate <IVER>
um <SIL> but they always say don't let the animals sleep with you and all that and with a cat and they curl up with you <SIL> it's hard to say <LAUGH-get <LAUGH> no but you know what <VOCNOISE> honestly <VOCNOISE> eventually <SIL> well it it took probably a year <IVER>
he stopped sneezing <IVER>
yknow he did sneeze but he knew i wasn't gonna get rid the cat i'd had her she was my daughter <IVER>
and so <SIL> eventually he did he's <SIL> and <SIL> he just got used to her <SIL> <IVER>
and he always said well i'm so allergic but <SIL> but then he didn't have any problems um-hum <IVER>
now when he goes to my sister's house and she <UNKNOWN> <SIL> has three cats and he's not around <VOCNOISE> <SIL> them <SIL> <IVER>
then when we leave his eyes are itching and <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> i mean so it is true <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> with different <SIL> pets <IVER>
but <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yes <VOCNOISE> you're right <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh i'm sure <IVER>
<IVER>
no <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> we have that many animals yknow people <IVER>
yeah <SIL> it is but <VOCNOISE> see i've always i <VOCNOISE> i have one floors where i live now i vacuum them i mean i'm just the type yknow i didn't want <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> pet hair and <IVER>
things yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> collecting but <SIL> it's hard <SIL> with my sister's cats because she has a little girl and no she didn't go home and vacuum every day <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <IVER>
i think when you have <LAUGH-two_or_more> <UNKNOWN> <LAUGH> <SIL> pets you hafta make a little bit more effort <SIL> <IVER>

flowers and <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i know <VOCNOISE> i am <LAUGH> <SIL> i can't wait because i <VOCNOISE> the house we live in <SIL> it's a half double with <SIL> we had a front porch and a deck which <VOCNOISE> i really decked out but <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i have like eighty plants my house now but <UNKNOWN> i just can't wait to have my own space i never <SIL> plant anything in the ground there because i thought well i'm going to leave yknow <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i just didn't wanna do that a lot of people do that but yknow <NOISE> it's just such an investment then when you leave and <IVER>
but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i really enjoy that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> wow that's great <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
oh they're beautiful <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <IVER>
yes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but that's great though <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well that's great <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
definitely <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <IVER>
yes <IVER>
yep <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <VOCNOISE> yknow columbus is so saturated with golf courses and my parents all through growing up <SIL> they played golf and <SIL> i really was interested in it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i just think enoughs enough so <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> yeah <SIL> <UNKNOWN> there's so many but <IVER>
i have to admit <CUTOFF-eh <SIL> when we go to try play golf sometimes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and not have a tee <NOISE> time you can't even get in <IVER>
so all over columbus they're all booked <IVER>
and so you keep thinking well <SIL> yknow they need more but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i was hoping they could use that land for something else <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> there's <SIL> yknow there's so many <SIL> not building but <SIL> yknow something maybe <SIL> especially in dublin <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's <HES-I> <HES-it's> probably it'll be good for columbus <IVER>
because i <UNKNOWN-f=?> <SIL> they feel they <VOCNOISE> have the need for it <SIL> there's so many golfers i mean that sports <VOCNOISE> <SIL> went sky high <UNKNOWN> mean when <HES-I> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my mom used to play golf <VOCNOISE> growing up and they only let them on <LAUGH-the> <LAUGH-golf> <LAUGH-course> just one day a week <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which is amazing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was like on a tuesday <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when i lived in florida a lot of the courses were like that too and i thought <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they're only allowing women one day a week <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> isn't that amazing <SIL> there's so many good women golfers now and but they said they're too slow and they always talk and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that just killed me when my mom that's the only day she could play and she wanted to play more <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so things have come a little bit <NOISE> yknow <NOISE> <SIL> better but um <SIL> there's still such restrictions with women <SIL> <IVER>
yknow in this sport especially i think golf <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
you can't <NOISE> no <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it is <SIL> but it it that was good for <SIL> new albany to have that i mean i think it <SIL> it was great to have it there and i think a lot of people <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> did enjoy going there because there's not very many women tournaments that come <SIL> around here <IVER>
yeah
