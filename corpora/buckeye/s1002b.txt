thirty on it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and his report card he's got like a one point two five average <SIL> so they take <SIL> jalena who has an a <SIL> him who has a d and they go well gee the average <CUTOFF-s=student> kid in the school is like c plus <SIL> and they're stupid at this school columbus public schools don't do any good <SIL> then you go to dublin worthington westerville <SIL> in order to get there you <SIL> you're not gonna be <SIL> in his condition <VOCNOISE> and you're not gonna be stupid because you're trying to <SIL> yknow <SIL> you probably both husband and wife work <SIL> so the intelligence is there <SIL> and you're not gonna have dumb people <SIL> living <SIL> and going to those schools because it's very expensive live in that area <SIL> so there's a natural prejudice that columbus is stupid <SIL> and worthington dublin and it's really <SIL> not true <SIL> it's just that <SIL> yknow <SIL> you can't <SIL> tell all the poor people <SIL> and the people that don't have <SIL> two parents don't come to school because we want our scores higher <SIL> but yknow when the <VOCNOISE> and when the news media goes look how bad brown school did this year <SIL> but they don't look to see <SIL> like jalena <SIL> they don't go well look at <SIL> the uh scores on the california achievement tests there's like <SIL> seventy five percent the kids that are getting like <SIL> yknow nineties and above <SIL> but twenty five percent are getting <SIL> f's and d's <IVER>
so it brings that <CUTOFF-do=down> and it's uh like yknow they're they're not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on <SIL> the test at both schools <SIL> i'll bet you they're all about the same <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> because like i think it's archie griffin that went to a really crummy school in uh <SIL> in in columbus <SIL> and to me <SIL> no matter how <SIL> bad of an area you live in and and <CUTOFF-ba=bad> bad a <CUTOFF-s=school> bad a school you think you're going to <SIL> if you want to do it <SIL> you can because it and <VOCNOISE> really in columbus public schools <SIL> if you have a learning disability <SIL> or yknow if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is <SIL> a psychologist <SIL> or a tutor or something to help you and <SIL> and in uh like <SIL> worthington and westerville dublin <SIL> yknow <SIL> they don't have the money to throw away and like catholic schools they don't have the money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get <SIL> pushed aside and <SIL> so yknow <SIL> as you can see i'm standing on my soapbox here i do like columbus public schools but yknow i <SIL> i i hate when people say yknow look at these test scores because it really doesn't reflect what's there because <SIL> it's like saying all kids carry guns to school <SIL> they don't <SIL> yknow and the media says well what has there been like maybe <SIL> five or six <SIL> people who have taken guns to school and killed people <SIL> well what about the uh <SIL> millions and millions of kids that go to school every day <SIL> do their homework <SIL> and yknow <SIL> do community service and stuff well well <UNKNOWN> well that's just to boring we don't want to hear that stuff <SIL> yknow <SIL> it's like <SIL> that that irritates me <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
there we go <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
uh they really have no self worth <SIL> because <SIL> yknow uh i uh i know a long time ago uh we went to a um <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-s=seminar> <SIL> what was <CUTOFF-tha=that> it's like a <UNKNOWN> a seminar <SIL> for the <SIL> ivy league schools which <SIL> i looked at the tuition and went <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow there was no way but <SIL> and i thought this is so stupid to be here but i listened to the man <SIL> <CUTOFF-the=there?> there was like four or five men talking and some women talking whatever and uh <SIL> they said yknow <SIL> if your <CUTOFF-k=kid> <SIL> if your child makes straight a's <SIL> and uh <SIL> applies at our school <SIL> we don't want them <SIL> and i'm like <SIL> what <SIL> he says uh <SIL> he says we look at two <SIL> two children sitting side by side this one's making straight a's <SIL> this one sort of made b's <SIL> but this one over here got into track when <SIL> he or she was in freshman's <SIL> and <SIL> and we noticed <SIL> every track meet <SIL> they basically <CUTOFF-wa=was> <SIL> were like <SIL> last <SIL> or second to last <SIL> but they did it for four years <SIL> then they <CUTOFF-w=were> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and and never got any better <SIL> then they got in marching band <SIL> and they were in that for four years <SIL> and sometimes we notice they marched and sometimes they didn't because they didn't learn their music <SIL> but they stayed with it <SIL> and they said then they like volunteered down at cosi <SIL> they didn't get paid a dime for this <SIL> but they did it because they enjoyed <SIL> helping and definite so like they go <SIL> we want that student over there <SIL> said you as a straight a student have proved nothing to us <SIL> and you over there as a b student have proved that <SIL> by gosh <SIL> yknow you'll try out for something <SIL> and if you don't do well you go <SIL> but i like doing it <SIL> and i'm gonna keep with it <SIL> yknow <SIL> and to me <SIL> the straight a student who does nothing <SIL> is like the kids who <SIL> go to school and shoot people <SIL> they have nothing in their life <SIL> at all and the other one has <SIL> yknow activities and <SIL> they're giving of themselves to the community yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library <CUTOFF-r=reading> <SIL> reading program and then they went on and they volunteer at cosi and <SIL> and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like <SIL> easter egg hunts for <SIL> the <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> school is a grade school and it's attached to <CUTOFF-Co=Columbus> <VOCNOISE> columbus alternative high school <SIL> so <SIL> um yknow i <CUTOFF-re=read> i read an <SIL> um <SIL> uh a uh resume that she <SIL> put in <SIL> for a scholarship and it was explaining how <SIL> the <SIL> the closest she got to crying at school was <SIL> when she would <SIL> uh <SIL> do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy <SIL> and <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> it was just <SIL> they were just so excited that <SIL> the kids went out and bought like a dollar or twos worth of candy and hid it out and they'd have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says <SIL> yknow those and things that <SIL> were important to her and <SIL> yknow <SIL> to me that makes <SIL> you feel like you're worth something but the kids that go yknow the ones who went to school i <SIL> yknow i don't see any <SIL> community service or <SIL> i don't know about <SIL> i i'm not a big <SIL> gung ho have to be religious person i mean i i feel i'm a christian but i'm not a church goer <SIL> and i don't think you hafta go there to be <SIL> a religious person <SIL> yknow but uh yknow i think <SIL> religion and community service and <SIL> feeling like you have given something to the community and <SIL> yknow you're just not <SIL> asking continuously for it yknow and and trying things <SIL> and failing at them <SIL> and going okay well <SIL> but i still like to <SIL> play basketball <SIL> i'm <SIL> terrible but i like to play and i can't make the team so what do i do i know i'll go to the y and play there <SIL> yknow <SIL> that <SIL> that's <SIL> what keeps kids out of trouble <SIL> and those that go to school and come home and either sit on the computer and <SIL> yknow what <SIL> do the chat room stuff or the e mail stuff or sit on the playing with video games i think those the ones that are the big problem children because they yknow mom and dad go <SIL> how can i get them to do something <SIL> and stay out of my hair <SIL> oh i know i'll buy them a nintendo <SIL> i'll buy them this sega i'll buy this look they're out of my way yknow because <SIL> yknow <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> and <SIL> and i i'll probably step on your toes here but i i'm not a firm believer of mom and dad both working <SIL> i my wife worked <SIL> until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked <SIL> at a school <SIL> so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was home <SIL> and yknow my parents didn't do that and i hated it <SIL> i hated coming home from school by myself every day <SIL> there was nobody there to talk to yknow and i did it for years and <SIL> and <SIL> i just feel that <SIL> yknow <SIL> i i hope you don't have children yet <SIL> do you <SIL> good <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> to me parents who <SIL> put kids in daycare <SIL> and <SIL> uh yknow after school programs <SIL> are like people who have cats and dogs <SIL> i get up in the morning <SIL> and i feed my <SIL> pet <SIL> my child <SIL> then i put him in the kennel <SIL> and i go to work <SIL> and i go gee i'd like to go for some drinks after work or go to a movie <SIL> we'll just put her in another kennel after work and we take her from one kennel to the other kennel we go we'll be back a little bit <SIL> and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off <IVER>
<SIL> and feed her <SIL> and i go <SIL> don't bother me <SIL> i've had a bad day and i'm tired <SIL> you go watch t v <SIL> and how are we raising children <SIL> doing that yknow <SIL> yknow and <CUTOFF-s=say> people say uh you hafta have both those incomes because we hafta do this i go <SIL> well why do you hafta have a house that's three hundred thousand dollars <SIL> why do you have have a brand new car <SIL> yknow isn't life sacrifices <CUTOFF-a=that> <SIL> aren't <SIL> aren't you supposed to like <SIL> do best for your children yknow i mean i my children don't have everything they don't have a <SIL> sega <SIL> yknow my daughter has a car that goes to <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> and it's twelve years old <SIL> yknow <SIL> and i made her buy it <SIL> i told her i says <SIL> i will not buy you a car <SIL> i said if you want a car you hafta buy it <SIL> and i said when it's time for maintenance you have to pay for it <SIL> because <SIL> she has to be responsible for things <SIL> and she appreciates that yknow and <SIL> yknow <SIL> i admire her i mean she's the <SIL> person i <SIL> never was that age yknow <NOISE> but <SIL> yknow and <SIL> i'd <SIL> i don't take <SIL> full responsibility for that but <IVER>
i'm very proud of the way her and her sister are but <SIL> i just think it's because mom was home <SIL> and <SIL> yknow there was somebody there to listen to them and it doesn't have to be mom i mean <SIL> um <SIL> yknow <SIL> mom can go work <SIL> and dad can stay home <SIL> there's nothing wrong with that either but i just think they need <SIL> mom or dad there everyday when they come home so they know when they come home and they've had a really bad day and something's really bothering them <SIL> they can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours <SIL> and letting it kind of fade away and then when everybody comes home it's like well <SIL> how how's school <SIL> okay <IVER>
yknow <SIL> anything bothering you <VOCNOISE> no <SIL> yknow <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh there we go <SIL> okay <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> well you're very smart <SIL> yknow <IVER>
