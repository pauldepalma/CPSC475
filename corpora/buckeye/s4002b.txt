<VOCNOISE> no i mean <VOCNOISE-it's_nothing_crazy> where they <VOCNOISE-think_they're> god and <IVER>
<HES-um> <IVER>
yeah one of <EXT-my> <SIL> uh <SIL> friends cousins went <VOCNOISE-to> that fraternity <SIL> <NOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <EXT-I> <SIL> don't remember what the cause was of his <VOCNOISE-death> <SIL> um <SIL> but i mean like said i mean that definitely <VOCNOISE-it's> a dangerous drug to be using <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i mean not <VOCNOISE-to_say> that they should <VOCNOISE-legalize> it or <VOCNOISE-anything> i mean obviously <SIL> that's pretty extreme to do <VOCNOISE> <HES-but> <SIL> like i <VOCNOISE-said> i mean it's something <EXT-more> to where <VOCNOISE-people> should know the risks of it <VOCNOISE> and know what goes <VOCNOISE-into> it <VOCNOISE> i mean it's sorta like if you saw <EXT-something> <SIL> laying on the street and you <VOCNOISE-decided_to> <SIL> eat it or whatever <IVER>
i <HES-mean> <SIL> you don't know <VOCNOISE-anything> behind it or what's going into it why would you do something like <VOCNOISE-that> <IVER>
um <SIL> if you're going to do something like <VOCNOISE-that> you better at least <LAUGH-know> <SIL> the <VOCNOISE-risks> involved <VOCNOISE-into> it and <EXT-what> <SIL> exactly you're doing <SIL> before you do <VOCNOISE-anything> like that <IVER>
not at all <IVER>
<EXT-no> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
<HES-I> <SIL> i don't think anyone really <VOCNOISE> affected anyone <CUTOFF-to=too> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-too> much <VOCNOISE> as far as that goes <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <HES-um> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> like i <VOCNOISE-said> i mean it's something <SIL> i <EXT-basically> <SIL> see it almost as being the <VOCNOISE-same> thing as like cigarettes or whatever <VOCNOISE> <EXT-where> <SIL> i mean yeah it's bad for you there's a lot of <VOCNOISE-tar> in it things like <VOCNOISE-that> <VOCNOISE> <HES-but> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-as> far as <SIL> what it <SIL> the effects it does to you it's no worse <VOCNOISE-than_anything> alcohol can do <VOCNOISE-to> you <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> so i <HES-mean> <SIL> i don't know i mean <SIL> i'm not sure if <VOCNOISE-they_should> actually go so far as to legalize it but i don't think it's <EXT-really> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-something> that they need to really spend that <VOCNOISE-much_time_trying> to control drug <EXT-problem> <EXT-wise> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-things> coming in i mean i <EXT-know> <SIL> i think it's like <VOCNOISE-Switzerland> or somewhere like <VOCNOISE-that> where they've legalized <EXT-drugs> <VOCNOISE> and they basically do it government <VOCNOISE-based> <VOCNOISE> where <VOCNOISE-the> government <SIL> actually gives them out <SIL> and the government gets the money for it <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i can almost see that as <EXT-being> <SIL> almost a good idea <EXT-here> <VOCNOISE> i mean obviously like i said <VOCNOISE-people> are gonna do it <SIL> no matter what i mean the same thing <VOCNOISE-with> <EXT-guns> <VOCNOISE> if <VOCNOISE-they> want it they'll get their hands on it doesn't matter what they have to do <VOCNOISE-to> it <SIL> <EXT-they'll> <SIL> they'll <LAUGH-come_by_it> <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> i mean actually i mean i could see that <SIL> they <EXT-could> <VOCNOISE> at <VOCNOISE-least_take> the money from and put it <EXT-to> <VOCNOISE> better <EXT-use> of some sorts if they did the <VOCNOISE-same_kinda_thing> <IVER>
not really no <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<HES-um> <VOCNOISE> it would a little bit <SIL> but at <VOCNOISE-the_same_time> <SIL> i mean it was <VOCNOISE-obviously> a long time ago i mean i don't know how <CUTOFF-mu=much> <SIL> how far in the <VOCNOISE-past> you have to <EXT-go> <VOCNOISE> for <VOCNOISE-things_to> be considered a problem of something coming up again <VOCNOISE> um i mean as long as he's not <SIL> didn't have any <VOCNOISE-history> of being like an addicted <EXT-user> <HES-or> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-anything> like <VOCNOISE-that> <SIL> i mean i <SIL> i can't <VOCNOISE-say> it really bothers me <VOCNOISE-too> much <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <HES-honestly> <SIL> it would <HES-be> <VOCNOISE> i'd probably base <VOCNOISE-the> decision <VOCNOISE-basically> <CUTOFF-pol=political> <SIL> political <VOCNOISE> um i can't <VOCNOISE-say> i'd really hold that <VOCNOISE-against> him or <VOCNOISE-anything> <VOCNOISE> obviously <VOCNOISE-it's> not <VOCNOISE-something> i'd be like oh good well <VOCNOISE-let's> vote for him <VOCNOISE-since_he> did that <IVER>
but <SIL> at <VOCNOISE-the_same> time i don't <VOCNOISE-think> i'd really hold it against him <IVER>
<HES-um> i mean <VOCNOISE-obviously> it's something that <SIL> happens <EXT-everyday> <HES-and> <SIL> things <VOCNOISE-like_that> <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <LAUGH> like <VOCNOISE-said> by no means am i <VOCNOISE-saying> yay go president clinton or anything <VOCNOISE-like_that> but <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> i mean i can't <VOCNOISE-say> i'd hold it <VOCNOISE-against> him for doing something like <VOCNOISE-that> i mean <VOCNOISE-it's_nothing> that threatened the <VOCNOISE-nation> or whatever <IVER>
i mean it's something he <VOCNOISE-has> to deal <VOCNOISE-with_he> has to deal with the problems with him <IVER>
<EXT-it's> up to him to resolve it <IVER>
i mean <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i <VOCNOISE-think> <EXT-more> <EXT-of> <VOCNOISE> along the <EXT-lines> <HES-of> <SIL> like physical abuses things like that <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <SIL> would <EXT-be> probably <VOCNOISE-crossing> the <EXT-line> <VOCNOISE> um like if <VOCNOISE-he> got <SIL> there were <EXT-alleges> <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-alleg=alleged> <SIL> uh excuse me <VOCNOISE> he was allegedly beating his wife or <VOCNOISE-something> like that <LAUGH-obviously> then yeah <HES-then> <SIL> that would cause a problem with <VOCNOISE-me> <HES-I'd> <SIL> i can't say that <SIL> i would vote for anyone like <VOCNOISE-that> <VOCNOISE> <HES-but> <SIL> i <HES-mean> just like small <VOCNOISE-things> like <VOCNOISE-that> <SIL> <EXT-where> it doesn't <EXT-really> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-threaten> the <VOCNOISE-nation> or <VOCNOISE-anything> and i mean it's <EXT-something> <SIL> that <EXT-happened> <IVER>
<SIL> i can't really see a problem <VOCNOISE-with> it <VOCNOISE> um but like i <VOCNOISE-said> i mean <EXT-if> he's <LAUGH-going_around> <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> picking fights things like <VOCNOISE-that> <VOCNOISE> <HES-then> <SIL> i <HES-mean> <SIL> i can't say i'd support anyone like <VOCNOISE-that> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i can't say that'd really bother me <VOCNOISE> like i said i mean <EXT-it's> something that's his choice his opinion what not <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> i mean it's up to him it doesn't <SIL> affect the <VOCNOISE-nation> <EXT-any> <HES-or> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-anything> like <VOCNOISE-that> i mean he's still <VOCNOISE> long he's making the right decisions or whatever <VOCNOISE> <HES-then> <IVER>
yeah i mean i can't say that they <SIL> be any difference with them <IVER>
<HES-um> <VOCNOISE> they did <EXT-briefly> like cover <VOCNOISE-things_like_that_with> like <VOCNOISE> religion and <VOCNOISE-health> classes things <VOCNOISE-like_that> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i mean they didn't really do <VOCNOISE-anything> too extensive on it they <NOISE-basically> as far as religion classes go they basically told what <VOCNOISE-the_Catholic> church believed about it <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> how they felt about it but i <NOISE-mean> they didn't <EXT-really> <EXT-condemn> <HES-or> <SIL> support it or <VOCNOISE-anything> like <VOCNOISE-that> i mean <EXT-they> <SIL> they <VOCNOISE-basically> did realize that it's <HES-more> <SIL> up to the person i mean <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-to> the most part yeah i mean <VOCNOISE-obviously> like <VOCNOISE-they_said> they <VOCNOISE-came> out and said <VOCNOISE-the_Catholic> <EXT-Church> <SIL> was <EXT-against> <SIL> it <SIL> but at the same <VOCNOISE-time> <VOCNOISE> like with the research things like that <EXT-where> <SIL> they're saying that it could be a mental disorder of some <VOCNOISE-sorts> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-where> i <EXT-mean> <SIL> they couldn't <VOCNOISE-can't_so> much really condemn it <SIL> <VOCNOISE-to> <SIL> to the point anymore <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE-they> used <VOCNOISE-to> <IVER>
um <IVER>
a few <VOCNOISE-times> that they did <CUTOFF-ex=?> <SIL> specifically <EXT-say> <VOCNOISE> um homosexuality <SIL> but <SIL> i mean there were other <VOCNOISE-things> that <VOCNOISE-they'd> cover <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE-it's> not like it was <VOCNOISE-just> an <VOCNOISE> all out <VOCNOISE-assault> on being gay or <VOCNOISE-anything_like_that> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<HES-um> <SIL> i really did not no <IVER>
<HES-um> <SIL> college wise i don't <HES-know> <NOISE> <SIL> anyone of college <VOCNOISE> age <VOCNOISE-that's> gay <IVER>
i do know a few <EXT-people> <SIL> that are <EXT-gay> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <EXT-they're> <VOCNOISE> in their thirties <IVER>
or so <IVER>
<HES-um> <SIL> they <EXT-were> people i met through friends <SIL> um <SIL> <EXT-actually> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> one of my <EXT-friend's> parents <SIL> had a friend that was <EXT-gay> <VOCNOISE> um and <SIL> just be over there whatever <SIL> i mean i can't say <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_see_any> big difference between <IVER>
gay people or <SIL> straight people so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> i would <VOCNOISE-say> <SIL> it doesn't <LAUGH-really_matter> either way honestly <VOCNOISE> i <EXT-mean> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-fact> of the matter is they <EXT-are> so deal <VOCNOISE-with> it i <EXT-mean> <SIL> get over it i mean
