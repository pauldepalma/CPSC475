think that that you with all the violence in the schools and that sort of thing I think people are starting to look at it a little differently <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah and it's not <VOCNOISE> I mean it gets it <SIL> any is too much but it's not that big a proportion that it's happening <VOCNOISE> but I remember even my son the third grade somebody kid brought a gun to school <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
he went to Columbus schools uh <SIL> uh <SIL> and the kid didn't know what he had he just found it laying around <SIL> his father's car in the <SIL> glove compartment <VOCNOISE> brought it in to show the other kids <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> that was very upsetting to my son he's very sensitive <SIL> uh <SIL> he used to be <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> again I don't know if that's normal for teenagers or not but he used <VOCNOISE> used to be very sensitive to other people and <SIL> but uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I don't think I <VOCNOISE> I don't know if he is or he just doesn't <SIL> won't let him be himself be right now but <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> and that's normal we understood that we <ERROR-ka=came> knew we knew a lot of stuff we were gonna <VOCNOISE> we raised him to be very independent <SIL> and I always said that we're gonna regret this someday <VOCNOISE> I said another ten years we'll be pleased but <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or I to be very independent <VOCNOISE> uh so it gets to point that <SIL> when we were first married pretty it was hard to make it simple decision on anything <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> yknow we've worked through that after twenty five years but <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> or to stand on our own or anything but <SIL> you know we learned to do it but <SIL> we always he was always very independent <SIL> <VOCNOISE> his teachers said <SIL> independent we said it said stubborn but <VOCNOISE> it's like even <SIL> go to Mcdonalds or something and he was <VOCNOISE> didn't want onions on anything he <SIL> if he ordered a <SIL> a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as <SIL> six and seven years old and <SIL> and tell them <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> which <HES-we> we encouraged that <IVER>
because we could know that <SIL> he'll need that someday I would never have done it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but it uh he he would he's <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and he's very opinionated <VOCNOISE> and it's interesting when he talks about <SIL> uh <SIL> anything <SIL> he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> you can tell that he's thought he's uh thought about it <SIL> and his <SIL> yknow clearly formulated what his stance is on it <VOCNOISE> and he's <SIL> very articulate about it <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> sometimes <SIL> his responses are immature but he's nineteen <IVER>
I mean <VOCNOISE> I'm sure at nineteen I was saying some really bizarre things too <VOCNOISE> uh but you can tell that he's thought about it <IVER>
so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because he and I always discuss <SIL> politics and stuff <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he had <CUTOFF-va=variety> <VOCNOISE> a variety <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> eighth grade is when he was probably in some ways his better year <SIL> uh <SIL> he was taking a <CUTOFF-com=computer> <SIL> had taken computer class for grading period <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it wasn't going well they were teaching keyboarding well he learned that when he was in third grade <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so we were talking to the teacher about it says well he's disruptive he's supposed be doing keyboarding exercises and he's writing programs <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> so anyways <SIL> and he said I knew the first day he was in here he knew every <CUTOFF-th=thing> thing that I was gonna teach this <UNKNOWN-couldn't_do_anything> <SIL> grading period well that <SIL> kind of flew up a red flag to me and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> can you give him other assignments <VOCNOISE> oh no he's got do what everybody else is doing <VOCNOISE> so we went to the principal and <SIL> I was <SIL> president of the <SIL> uh parent's advisory committee at the time so I had an easy access to the principal <VOCNOISE> he took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library and the librarian worked <SIL> with him one on one teaching data base and spreadsheet <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> applications to him <VOCNOISE> but then <SIL> but he had another teacher in the ninth grade who contacted us his english teacher <VOCNOISE> and <ERROR-he=she> she <CUTOFF-se=said> said told us uh said he knows everything I wanna teach <VOCNOISE> so I want your permission to give him a separate curriculum and she did she but he was <SIL> using reading books like invisible man <SIL> my <CUTOFF-e=Ellimon> <SIL> Ellimen Ellison <VOCNOISE> Ralph Ellison <SIL> and Ellimen guess it is <VOCNOISE> anyway um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and writing papers on it he was reading like three books by an author and then trying to write a short story in that author's style <VOCNOISE> and she still tested him with the other kids just make sure she hadn't missed any he hadn't missed anything <VOCNOISE> and she was he was using her grad school notes to write papers and stuff like this <SIL> and uh <SIL> it was <SIL> he loved it <VOCNOISE> and that's what he needed <VOCNOISE> though when he got to high school <SIL> and we would talk to teachers about they said no they couldn't do that <VOCNOISE> uh it was very frustrated <SIL> frustrating <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
in the kin <IVER>
in uh <SIL> first grade his teacher <SIL> knew that he needed that but the principal would not allow her to do it <SIL> and that's one reason we put him in different school for second grade <VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah and uh <SIL> in the eighth grade he took the ninth grade proficiency test and passed all four parts <SIL> the first time <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> so he was learning what they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> were <SIL> teaching which and that's another problem teaching to a test but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> that's a whole different problem <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <IVER>
right <IVER>
and you learn what you have to to get through the test course I did that <SIL> when I was here at school <IVER>
uh <SIL> if was a class I <SIL> knew I had to take I didn't really want to <VOCNOISE> that's what you do <VOCNOISE> uh you just get through it <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
I was bored in high school and I wasn't all that bright <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh he needed <SIL> that but uh if I uh <IVER>
it it was difficult <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I can't tell you how many times he had papers or projects due at school that we'd just have to sit there with him to keep him focused on doing it <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> one of the <SIL> uh diagnosises probably <VOCNOISE> A D H D which has trouble <VOCNOISE> with uh working memory how and how to get a project done and stuff like that <VOCNOISE> uh we taught him how to do time lines and <VOCNOISE>  <ERROR-gat=got> charts and things like that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but it was very difficult for him be task oriented <IVER>
and it still is <VOCNOISE> uh and that was the problem with school he just wouldn't do the work <SIL> I mean he give him a test and he could pass it <VOCNOISE> do really well but <SIL> he just wouldn't do the work <SIL> <IVER>
well he wasn't really diagnosed then until just the last couple years uh <SIL> and part of the problem was it was fairly new and everybody was being diagnosed A D H D uh and it wasn't really there weren't really good screening instruments for that there are now <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> and we've often felt that he needed to have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> gifted <VOCNOISE> emphasis for gifted children because <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and the uh <SIL> the schools wouldn't do that for him because his grades weren't good enough because he didn't do the work <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <SIL> the state of Ohio's definition of <SIL> a gifted child is uh anyone who goes scores seventy percent or higher on <SIL> some test that they give <VOCNOISE> well uh yknow they saying half the students in Columbus schools were gifted students now that's not <SIL> it can't it's impossible <VOCNOISE> gifted students there's fourteen different characteristics to look at you can't just look at <SIL> one thing <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> one of them they'd looked at in columbus was <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> how well he was doing in school <SIL> well gifted children you <SIL> <CUTOFF-ofte=often> have the high uh one of the highest drop rate of <SIL> out rates in schools they're not doing well <VOCNOISE> so they need to be taught differently <SIL> and then they cut this moneys uh <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-mu=my> my feeling is you know there's lot of <UNKNOWN> programs in school there's sponsored by the federal government particularly <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh to help the the students are that are behind and that's important <IVER>
and it should be important but there needs the students that are the other end need the help too <VOCNOISE> lot of people think if you have a child that's gifted that all your problems are solved but it's not it's a different set of problems there's personality quirks that go with that emotional issues <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
and the they're not willing to do that for gifted students <IVER>
only if for those <UNKNOWN> students who are <CUTOFF-achu=acheivers> high achievers who are very bright <VOCNOISE> talented may be truly gifted <VOCNOISE> who are willing to <VOCNOISE> jump through the hoops <IVER>
and those the and the other students were lost <VOCNOISE> to the system <SIL> and that's what happened with him <IVER>
and and it's just <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well we figure in a few years he will <SIL> um <IVER>
that's what we figure in a few years he'll be fine <SIL> it's just getting there <SIL> it's been very difficult <VOCNOISE> I mean there's times when we didn't know where he was <SIL> for <SIL> a week at <CUTOFF-tay=time> a week at a time he <VOCNOISE> I was driving <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lane avenue once and saw him begging money on the street and <SIL> that's <SIL> it's it's hit pretty heavy load to go through it really is <IVER>
right <IVER>
no I had no idea where he was <SIL> uh and at the time <VOCNOISE> my mother in law was in a nursing home had Alzheimers and my father in law was in the hospital <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh essentially dying <SIL> and so we were dealing with all of this <VOCNOISE> at the same time and it was I mean there was one night I remember we were ready to leave the hospital about seven thirty we checked to see if there was any messages at home to see if we'd heard from him <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and got a message that my mother in law had fallen and she was in an <SIL> emergency room the same hospital fortunately so went down there <VOCNOISE> then on the way home <SIL> got a phone call on the cell phone <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> from the hospital that my father in law had to had some bleeding so we had to go back to hospital <SIL> and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was all and this was not unusual <VOCNOISE> it was a horrible period <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> I think what <SIL> made my wife and I the angriest was that he's the only one that really could control his behavior the others couldn't <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and their needs were <SIL> immediate <IVER>
he's admits now that he felt neglected at that period <IVER>
well <SIL> how he felt and knowing that weren't neglecting him were two different things <VOCNOISE> we've always emphasized that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> knowing what's right <SIL> or knowing that <VOCNOISE> what's just is one thing it's dealing with the emotions is another one <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> like dealing the with this adoption of the baby we know that that's best but dealing with the emotions of it this is a you know it's grand <VOCNOISE> we're very family oriented <VOCNOISE> and it's this is a grandchild we'll never see <IVER>
and it's very hard on my wife and I <SIL> but we'll get through it <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> it's uh well you're right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes <SIL> so it's tough to go through but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he uh I guess he always did take things a little on the extreme <IVER>
so it's <VOCNOISE> probably wasn't unexpected we just weren't prepared for it I don't think you could be prepared for it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right and he just pretty much <SIL> cut ties with all of his old friends and <VOCNOISE> we still see them all uh a lot <VOCNOISE> and we were close with their parents and <IVER>
hasn't for about four years he refuses to <VOCNOISE> refuses to live with us <VOCNOISE> because we have rules <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he seemed confused <SIL> parenting with controling <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> I mean we would like when he was fourteen years old we wouldn't let him go out and take a walk at <CUTOFF-el=eleven> three in the morning and he couldn't understand that <LAUGH> I'm <LAUGH-sorry> <LAUGH> I don't think that's being <VOCNOISE> a bad parent <VOCNOISE> <SIL> to tell you no <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <IVER>
