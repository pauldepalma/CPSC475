<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah and <HES-UNKNOWN> and I think it could work <SIL> uh but I don't think people were <SIL> ready to accept it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and if <SIL> the people <CUTOFF-filli=filling> giving the information aren't ready to accept it then <SIL> <IVER>
it's not gonna work <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> I'm not sure <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I'm not sure that the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the federal government has the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ability to convince enough people <SIL> to do it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and I don't think it's I I think the people that are going to be <SIL> ready to accept it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> go with it are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I don't think <EXCLUDE-you're> gonna get a <SIL> good cross section population <SIL> I think the people would be willing to understand it and go with it more if gonna be the more educated in this sort of thing then you're leaving out a large part the population so I'm not sure it's gonna give valid results anyway <SIL> <IVER>
period <SIL> and it's that's a long process I mean this has been going on for two hundred years this way <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and people are suspicious of government <SIL> asking questions <NOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
