<VOCNOISE> oh we now run on the gregorian and or that sort of thing <VOCNOISE> back to your question i think you were asking are <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah that's right when you're that was your question are we gonna have doom we're gonna have a catastrophe we gonna get this thing turned around before we have <VOCNOISE> yes <SIL> uh i think we will <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh but i don't <SIL> think we're ready to turn around yet i think we're still <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> well this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four five times i <CUTOFF-th=think> <SIL> uh it it is coming upon <EXT-us> <EXT-so> rapidly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-w=well> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> strongly predict <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that in just <SIL> twenty years <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and possibly ten <VOCNOISE> <SIL> each and every one of us in the world are gonna be interconnected with one another <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but once again its an impersonal <SIL> uh inner connection <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i can i'll be able to contact you when you're over in paris and i'll be over <CUTOFF-ih=in> in in <UNKNOWN-Octey> ohio and out there on the farm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i am probably watching the geese swimming up and down the little lake <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you're sitting over there in paris having a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> coffee something something <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah it <LAUGH-does> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> well i i enjoy this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but it it'll be impersonal <EXT-uh> because here you are <HES-eh> <HES-oo> i'm <CUTOFF-n=not> i can't face you i don't know whether you're really kidding me in what you're <LAUGH-talking_about> sitting there in the <VOCNOISE> in <EXT-that> uh street <LAUGH-cafe_or_not> <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but i really do think we're gonna be interconnected in that sense and uh um <SIL> it it becomes <CUTOFF-ih=impersonal> so much more <SIL> impersonal i guess i'm very strong about the <CUTOFF-p=??> term <VOCNOISE> personal versus impersonal inner communications <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-and> the <EXT-bad> that we've talked about i think will be a part of that ten and twenty years from now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i think we will have begun by that time to try to clean up the act if you will <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh going back to the <ERROR-poli=political> political question i think that financial things who i <ERROR-thank=think> think we will start <SIL> we'll start slowing that down oh i think we'll have less influence <VOCNOISE> uh in the terms of finance and i don't think we'll get back to abraham lincoln days <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but uh <CUTOFF-w=well> if we can swing that pendulum back <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh i think we <VOCNOISE> i think we can and i think we will <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think we can do the same thing with communications uh <SIL> i think we can <VOCNOISE> <SIL> eliminate a <EXT-lot> of the uh bad <VOCNOISE> bad influences <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i do know that over time what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here sort of like the definition of need <VOCNOISE> <SIL> versus luxury <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh those definitions change the definition of socialism democracy that slowly have changed over these times <VOCNOISE> well the same thing will true <SIL> <VOCNOISE> be true with those <VOCNOISE> it's still functioning <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> excuse me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and i think we will also <SIL> slowly swing that pendulum on back to the <SIL> <EXT-and> <SIL> to the family again <VOCNOISE> there are those doomsayer from my point of view are saying that uh <SIL> in in many years to come <VOCNOISE> there won't be such a thing as a family <SIL> uh it's just <HES-you> <VOCNOISE> you go out here you meet a <VOCNOISE> an opposite sex you <CUTOFF-procri=procreate> procreate and you go on your way she goes on her way <VOCNOISE> and she's just as satisfied about going her way as you are going your way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <CUTOFF-ye=yes> yes a lot of that is true <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but i think that <SIL> uh i think that i don't think that's gonna ever happen i think we'll turn that thing around <VOCNOISE> i think this so called divorce rate program as i talked about awhile ago that <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> every <SIL> well fifty percent of the people who marry within five years <VOCNOISE> are no longer together i think that will <SIL> will change and that <SIL> is a very significant thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family <IVER>
