<VOCNOISE> if <CUTOFF-w=we> if we really score sports <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> the game of sports not the <CUTOFF-administra=administration> the administration of sports is just as unethical as the business world <SIL> it is <SIL> unethical <VOCNOISE> and it's one of the biggest problems we have in our society <VOCNOISE> because we've emphasized <VOCNOISE> sports <VOCNOISE> along with the theater <VOCNOISE> as being <SIL> oh the <VOCNOISE> way to <EXT-go> <VOCNOISE> and that the poor <VOCNOISE> the poorest benchmarks you could have <VOCNOISE> in terms of financial <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> appreciation <VOCNOISE> sure you <UNKNOWN> thing is you <VOCNOISE> market demands the uh dollar that type of thing well yeah <VOCNOISE> let them do it <VOCNOISE> but the thing is <VOCNOISE> it gets almost be <UNKNOWN> like a lawsuit case <VOCNOISE> we are <VOCNOISE> crazy and insane people <VOCNOISE> again gets back to <VOCNOISE> ethics <VOCNOISE> do you think <VOCNOISE> do you think i'm worth <VOCNOISE> thirty million <EXT-dollars> <VOCNOISE> let me ask you let <VOCNOISE> let me ask you question <VOCNOISE> why in the hell are you coming and asking for thirty million <EXT-dollars> <SIL> don't you think you're <VOCNOISE> <EXT-uncouth> <IVER>
and yet <VOCNOISE> we sit down and negotiate for it <VOCNOISE> and then on top of it <VOCNOISE> those people that participate in the <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> sponsors <VOCNOISE> are <VOCNOISE> just as bad <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i think it was then <VOCNOISE> a nice thing about we <VOCNOISE-had> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> we had uh <SIL> grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state <SIL> in some cases <VOCNOISE> we didn't see them that much <VOCNOISE> we made a part that <VOCNOISE> uh we communicated with the grandparents regularly <SIL> and when we did <CUTOFF-i=it> it was a special <EXT-time> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-we> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> emphasized the fact that <HES-um> <SIL> <HES-uh> <SIL> yknow kids wanna do certain things okay they saw their mother <VOCNOISE> go out and maybe <EXT-do> some additional things to work for that <VOCNOISE> uh the aspect <VOCNOISE> we uh asked them if they wanted to go on um <VOCNOISE> a project with the class so forth fine <VOCNOISE> but you gotta participate in it too we we'll match you with what you come up with <VOCNOISE> we made them part of the <EXT-owner> <SIL> we gave them responsibilities <VOCNOISE> they grew up with the aspect <VOCNOISE> they learned by being around <VOCNOISE> some older people <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> which uh i think was good <IVER>
because uh again i said you <VOCNOISE> bring up you get wisdom from that as long as you're listening to them <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <EXT-some> people <SIL> i don't care what their age was they just blew them <EXT-off> <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <SIL> and so that plus you have they <VOCNOISE> i think a understanding of um <VOCNOISE> the schooling <VOCNOISE> they came from <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools <VOCNOISE> i certainly did not want them to go to public schools <VOCNOISE> and even when going to ohio state <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> compared to miami university i saw a difference i see a differences in the standards of the of the students <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i believe and i've seen it with my son going to ohio state that his <VOCNOISE> morals <VOCNOISE> that he's gained through his uh <VOCNOISE> pre-college years <VOCNOISE> are staying with him <VOCNOISE> uh and i'm very grateful that there's uh spiritual guidance i keep telling these guys <VOCNOISE> guys <UNKNOWN> my daughter and son <VOCNOISE> excuse me <VOCNOISE> that um <SIL> yknow they'd come to me for <VOCNOISE> answers <VOCNOISE> now i think <VOCNOISE> now i <EXT-know> that's something that's probably the other problem is sometimes maybe the <CUTOFF-s=?> <VOCNOISE> the the <HES-um> siblings <EXT-or> the children do not have a parent to go to <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> again let me <ERROR-arate=reiterate> <CUTOFF-rei=reiterate> reiterate <VOCNOISE> we don't have a smooth marriage <VOCNOISE> they saw us have difficult times <VOCNOISE> and they saw us <SIL> saw us our spouses crying together <VOCNOISE> forgiving one another <VOCNOISE> arguing with another <VOCNOISE> just as much as you can have a being human relationship they saw that <VOCNOISE> they saw the love for one another <VOCNOISE> they saw <VOCNOISE> over night where i'd start take caring for my dad <VOCNOISE> because my mother died instantly yknow like short term an hour <VOCNOISE> and now he has a stroke <NOISE> i didn't know whether <VOCNOISE> i stay out of their <EXT-lives> <VOCNOISE> and i had to learn all that <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> i had <VOCNOISE-take_care> of <VOCNOISE-him> but then they saw my <EXT-wife> <SIL> <VOCNOISE-taking> over some my role at <EXT-home> <VOCNOISE> so we swing them that's why i said a team <EXt-player> <VOCNOISE> we knew what we had do <VOCNOISE> uh my son might come home i said well gee yknow he he he might smart off my wife will say hey <SIL> that's your dad give him respect <IVER>
oh <VOCNOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> okay it's part of growing up <UNKNOWN> and i i've been there done that too but still <VOCNOISE> you have to <VOCNOISE> you have to um <VOCNOISE> know there's respect out there to be warranted <VOCNOISE> and you expect it <VOCNOISE> and not just <SIL> demand it <VOCNOISE> you got to <VOCNOISE> you have to work to show <VOCNOISE> respect and then you should get respect for it <VOCNOISE> but then <VOCNOISE> they saw the interaction with the elderly people <VOCNOISE> the school he went to <VOCNOISE> a lot of public involvement public service required <VOCNOISE> the teachers <VOCNOISE> i often ask the teachers i've gone to sporting events <VOCNOISE> and their teachers are there <SIL> ticket <EXT-takers> <VOCNOISE> uh monitoring the crowd wherever the kids <VOCNOISE> i ask them i said do you guys ever go home <VOCNOISE> said <EXT-no> <VOCNOISE> oh yeah i said <VOCNOISE> but they're always there <VOCNOISE> they're not there just teaching a class <VOCNOISE> they're not there <VOCNOISE> preparing the class <SIL> they're there <VOCNOISE> after the class they're there for the student <VOCNOISE> and they make the student feel part of the family <VOCNOISE> that is a continuation of my philosophy at home <VOCNOISE> we interact <VOCNOISE> the school <VOCNOISE> is great <VOCNOISE> you have people that are on the clock oh <VOCNOISE> time to quit <VOCNOISE> they're gone <VOCNOISE> those people don't know meaning of life <NOISE> they will never know the meaning of life <VOCNOISE> but if they stay around <VOCNOISE> try to extend themselves little more with somebody that's having problems at work <VOCNOISE> and are willing to work with that person <VOCNOISE> i didn't say <VOCNOISE> willing to work <VOCNOISE> not knowing <SIL> they're going to be compensated <VOCNOISE> because they'll be compensated <SIL> not necessarily materialistically they'll be <CUTOFF-mantaw=?> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-then> <VOCNOISE> more than they're expected they'll be <VOCNOISE> recompensated somewhere <VOCNOISE> but the thing is to <VOCNOISE> lend an open hand <VOCNOISE> not knowing <VOCNOISE> well gee what's for <VOCNOISE> what's in it for me <VOCNOISE> what's in it for you is uh intangible <VOCNOISE> are you willing <IVER>
then <IVER>
then you have a choice there <VOCNOISE> you would not necessarily <SIL> uh have <SIL> you should've had more self control <VOCNOISE> and not had the child <VOCNOISE> don't expect me to pay for your <VOCNOISE> uh lack of uh will power <VOCNOISE> that's <VOCNOISE> that is <SIL> a selfish attitude <SIL> that's stealing <SIL> as well <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> i'm sure somewhere <VOCNOISE> i'm sure somewhere along the line that they would work things out to try to help her over those <VOCNOISE> bumps <VOCNOISE> it wouldn't be long term <VOCNOISE> and they would know that it would not be long term <VOCNOISE> but that's the intangible i'm saying you have somebody there because <VOCNOISE> she's giving up her time and not to make the high bucks <VOCNOISE> but <CUTOFF-sh=she> what she's bringing about is developing a character in a person <VOCNOISE> to bring about the spirituality in a person that's gonna carry them all through life <VOCNOISE> she's <EXT-also> <VOCNOISE> <HES-um> <VOCNOISE> tithing <SIL> more than <VOCNOISE-tithing> probably <VOCNOISE> uh which uh i always uh kid with people i said the author <UNKNOWN> said ten percent tithing <VOCNOISE> knew inflation he knew great about <VOCNOISE> economics ten percent is ten percent <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> uh on top of that yknow <VOCNOISE> we talked about economics uh <VOCNOISE> little further here <VOCNOISE> uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and the <CUTOFF-chi=Chinese> and germans so forth <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> boy yknow <VOCNOISE> taking that page out of the old bible aren't they <VOCNOISE> we don't <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
