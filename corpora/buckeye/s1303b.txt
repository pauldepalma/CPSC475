<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then they physically died <SIL> before they got a chance to live <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and when their spirit wakes up <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and finds out that they're physically dead and they can't do anything in a physical world anymore <VOCNOISE> they want to <SIL> draw themselves to especially if they were a bad person <SIL> <VOCNOISE-word_word> <SIL> they want to draw them to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the brightest thing <IVER>
<SIL> which are <SIL> children of light <IVER>
and as the way i put it it's kind of new agey and i don't like new agey stuff but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow it's <EXT-the> best example is moths <SIL> from the dark when you flip on a light <SIL> the moths will go right to it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a child like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a young man like that is very impressionable very young still <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh these bad spirits will be <SIL> flocked right to him <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so when he did that though i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's medication out there that can help people like i said i don't wanna see people with brain injury <SIL> <VOCNOISE> with mental illness <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or with any kind of disability <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> use that <SIL> as an excuse <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> for their behavior <SIL> because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if they were an asshole before their brain injury <SIL> they're gonna be <SIL> <VOCNOISE> an asshole after their brain injury five times <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> it's magnified <HES-and> <HES-and> <HES-or> <SIL> <EXT-yeah> they have that choice they can say well listen <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you don't understand and blah blah blah now i've tried that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but the best i can do now is try and advocate for myself in terms of listen <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh i hear what you're saying <SIL> but i'm trying to show you that <SIL> uh <SIL> and tell you how i work best <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so as long as you can try not to dictate to me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and allow me some freedom <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and give me goals of what you want accomplished and give me the freedom to accomplish them the way that i can do it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um not by quotas <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and deadlines and <SIL> crap like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i can show you what to do and <HES-that's> <HES-that's> the struggle i'm having right now i'm trying to find employment where people will <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> cut me some slack yknow and i wanted to do some driving but <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh because at least out on the road yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't have to put up with anyone's crap <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> long driving long distances is not good for me <SIL> focusing and concentrating <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and i i've had <VOCNOISE> yknow several accidents several tickets <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean i've even had uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow two other head injuries <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> as a result of <SIL> the one <SIL> <VOCNOISE> trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean it's <CUTOFF-ju=just> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah i mean when i when you come down to these things there's uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> people with mental illness and with a disability <SIL> <VOCNOISE> are trying to pawn off their responsibility onto <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> everybody but themselves <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow well the medical doctors if they would of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> seen this guy and given him medication he wouldn't of went out there and <VOCNOISE> killed somebody <SIL> yknow shoulda would have could have man <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if the guy stopped taking his medication of his own free will <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that was his responsibility to take that medicine every day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just like it's mine take mine every day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when i stop taking mine that was my responsibility which is why <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't wanna go to the legal system to try and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> make an excuse <SIL> even though there's a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> some law that protects people that if they were drunk <SIL> or <SIL> <VOCNOISE> on the influence of medication or <SIL> <VOCNOISE> or off the influence of medication <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <UNKNOWN> in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that they wouldn't be <VOCNOISE> <SIL> liable <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and i'm saying <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i could take that route <SIL> but it it would cost me a lot of money that i don't have <SIL> to get the legal defense <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it be just <VOCNOISE> best for me to take the responsibility like i have <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i sold the car that i had to my sister <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i'm going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed a lease for <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> but i'm gonna make them come after me <SIL> <LAUGH-yknow> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_mean_uh> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> i already went to court once and <SIL> and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ev=even> well i even <CUTOFF-wi=with> even with the evidence being in my favor <SIL> i mean i was only at this place three months <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i didn't do any damage to it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and the walls did not need painted i wasn't there long enough to make them dirty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> their own person even went through on a first run through after i moved out <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and my mother and i cleaned that thing spotless top bottom bathrooms and washed the floors and mopped the floors and everything <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and uh their own person came through an said it rated the paint an a which meant according to their system a meant no <IVER>
no painting was needed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh well then <SIL> then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and they uh scratched out the first rating and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> changed it to a lower rating <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and even though that evidence was in front of a magistrate <IVER>
and he could see <SIL> uh i'd assume he's educated and not stupid otherwise he wouldn't be a magistrate <SIL> <VOCNOISE> could see that that person did that <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> and it was suspect <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah he still ruled in their favor <IVER>
<SIL> so i'm not gonna get any fairness or justice out of that but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh so they sent me the award saying that they decided in their favor and all that crap well <SIL> yknow fine <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but i'm not gonna <VOCNOISE> not gonna pay them till they contact me again <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> or take me to court again <SIL> yknow they got the money i don't <IVER>

<SIL> there's a lot of uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <SIL> how how the training <SIL> is done with some of these animals yknow some of them are <SIL> treated very cruelly <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> to get them to do what they do to even to help like blind people <EXT-or> <EXT-to> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um help people that have other physical disabilities um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <HES-you> you can tell from the way the <EXT-dog> <EXT-is> <SIL> in terms of uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> with with the <CUTOFF-w=way> the way the dog behaves with the person that has the disability <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh that they been trained for um <SIL> you can tell <SIL> whether they've been <SIL> <ERROR-tre=trained> trained the right way or whatever so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i thought about that but <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-I> yknow i haven't given it much more then <SIL> yknow just the thought but yknow i looked in the veterinary assistant i went in there and it wasn't uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i was there just for a half a day and yknow they were telling me about some of these people out there <EXT-that> uh <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> yknow i don't understand the law again but yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's people out there that will go out and will buy a dog <SIL> yknow <SIL> nice dog <SIL> and uh because they don't wanna make the time to train it <SIL> and spend the time with it because they take a lot of time and discipline and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> love and care <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just like a child <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i couldn't be part of a veterinary practice that uh did that <IVER>
<SIL> and unfortunately <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they have to do what the people with the pets say <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but it's just i couldn't be around that and <EXT-then> yknow i would go off on people that would do that bring that in <SIL> i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth <LAUGH-sometimes> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah i'm not a violent man either even as big as i am yknow yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
