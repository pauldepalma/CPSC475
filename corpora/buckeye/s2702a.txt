<SIL> nobody ever <SIL> yknow what they wanted me do was <SIL> put him on ritalin <SIL> and i didn't like him on ritalin i didn't like what it did to him <IVER>
uh it turned him into a zombie <IVER>
yeah i <IVER>
i mean i'm used to those uh boy like yknow <VOCNOISE> jumping all over the house and <IVER>
uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow just always just <SIL> active <SIL> and he's always been very active in sports <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but when i put him on the ritalin he was um <SIL> laying on the couch yknow just <SIL> zombied out <IVER>
<IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i didn't know yknow what the problem was and <SIL> yknow i just kept having these problems with him so they told me i need take him the school said i need take him psychiatrist psychologist <VOCNOISE> and uh so i took him and <SIL> she said do you think this is normal <SIL> yknow because he's like <VOCNOISE> rolling off the <EXT-chair> and <VOCNOISE> banging dolls together i <CUTOFF-s=said> i don't know i said i got one brother <SIL> i don't know how boys are supposed to be <SIL> she says well this is not normal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm like okay <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so uh i don't know i tried taking him to um <SIL> psychologists <SIL> they did like behavioral <VOCNOISE> therapy <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i brought him here to ohio state and put him in a <VOCNOISE> an experiment <SIL> uh he was in it for about three years <SIL> working with a food supplement <SIL> and uh <SIL> it actually did <SIL> real well for him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the researcher <EXT-gave> <EXT-me> what he yknow <CUTOFF-uh=it's> <HES-it's> like sort of like taking vitamins <VOCNOISE> he gave <EXT-me> supplies of that even <SIL> after the <SIL> project was over <VOCNOISE> but then after there wasn't any more he couldn't give it to me and it cost too much <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> for me to buy it <IVER>
i've never heard of it <SIL> being developed commercially <IVER>
so <SIL> uh <SIL> he finally decided uh <SIL> yknow after <SIL> oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his <SIL> <VOCNOISE> kept his <SIL> desk in the hallway <SIL> yknow <IVER>
yeah they'd just kick him to the hallway he was either <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> in the hallway or in <SIL> uh <SIL> the office and and the nuns would say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivia questions <IVER>
<NOISE> that was grade school <IVER>
yknow the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting into any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so when he uh was a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking i gotta get it together what am i gonna do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so he uh <SIL> agreed to go to psychiatrist and uh <SIL> so he went on ritalin <SIL> uh <SIL> so he took the ritalin through his <SIL> last <SIL> of his junior year and his senior year <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now he's on a medication they call uh wellbutrin <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> his doctor um <SIL> doesn't believe in <SIL> ritalin <IVER>
so <SIL> he gives him a drug called wellbutrin <SIL> which is a <SIL> yknow <SIL> like an antidepressant type thing that they said works for uh <SIL> a d h d <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but it really helped him yknow concentrate <SIL> to be able to <SIL> study <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
yeah he's got energy <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <SIL> i'm <SIL> saying that it's not right for some people but <SIL> yknow wasn't right for my son <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it is <NOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> because pediatricians are able to dispense it and <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i just <SIL> yknow felt like <SIL> trying to avoid it as much as possible yknow growing up <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> see that's that's the difference uh worthington has a <SIL> yknow program for them um <SIL> one of the women that i worked with <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she was having so many problems similar to mine <SIL> and her <CUTOFF-clipping=word>ch=child? son was in um columbus schools and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she moved to westerville and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> put him in this class for that and <SIL> it took care of it <IVER>
they don't have that <SIL> for <SIL> columbus schools <IVER>
i don't have a good opinion of <SIL> uh columbus schools <SIL> at all <SIL> no not at all <IVER>
no i i i don't think so <IVER>
well it's gotta come from the top <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i <UNKNOWN> i just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student <SIL> from every direction <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i would say yknow it's an organizational <SIL> problem with no yknow no motivation <SIL> uh <SIL> yknow to do their job <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow properly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now <SIL> i live down the street from what they call c.a.h.s. it's the columbus uh alternative <SIL> high school <SIL> and uh you get there through a lottery system <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they have the best reputation of all the columbus schools <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and uh those kids leave there getting full scholarships <VOCNOISE> uh my son went there one year <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was a disaster for him <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> but yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a very <CUTOFF-clipping=word>en=environment <SIL> and nonstructured environment <SIL> which <SIL> <VOCNOISE> my son wouldn't have worked <SIL> in and then they don't have sports but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> these kids get <SIL> scholarships to some of the major colleges throughout the united states and we're talking big money <CUTOFF-scholarsh=scholarships> full scholarships <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so if they're able to do it there at that one school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they could <IVER>
they could do it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <SIL> granddaughter my one granddaughter <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they live in springfield they just moved to springfield and she goes to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> kindergarten <SIL> only a half day <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and this child is only uh five years old <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh he has them reading the newspaper <SIL> watching the news <SIL> she told me a story about <CUTOFF=col_columbus> christopher columbus um discovering america that was so <SIL> deep and intense <SIL> <VOCNOISE> couldn't believe it was coming from a five year old <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so this is what the teacher is doing down there <IVER>
and she wouldn't have learned that a whole day kindergarten here <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i would say in springfield yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i can't say yknow i cant say that it's an <CUTOFF-ex=expectation> <SIL> expectation <HES-word> i i still say it has to come from the top down <IVER>
uh <SIL> you've gotta have the leadership <SIL> uh you've gotta have the right people <SIL> uh <SIL> to have this <SIL> school structured <SIL> properly <SIL> and the yknow the people with the right credentials <SIL> uh for the job <SIL> yknow <SIL> and uh <SIL> i'm telling you <SIL> some of these principals <SIL> that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> that i've dealt with <NOISE> <SIL> uh were highly overpaid <SIL> as far as i was concerned for what they were doing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> yknow one <CUTOFF-gah=guy> <VOCNOISE> one principal that <SIL> from my um daughter's high school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he was out partying all the time they <SIL> yknow they <SIL> he was <CUTOFF-come=coming> he was riding around in a corvette <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh he tried to take me out <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and he was always like really red faced and the kids would say yknow he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and that was one of the better schools <SIL> in columbus <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> yknow i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of um <SIL> uh principals driving big fabulous cars and <IVER>
not doing anything <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <SIL> son uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow with his disorder <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he would constantly be uh <SIL> late <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> for school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i uh <SIL> called the school <SIL> and told them <SIL> this was in high school
