<SIL> i think <SIL> people are still fairly racist i don't think it's near as bad as it was but at the same time <SIL> i mean i can't say i blame the white community so much for it <SIL> i would say it's probably both <SIL> the white and <SIL> i guess <SIL> any other race relation's fault <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i mean as far as like if you look at the black communities things like that <VOCNOISE> you have like b e t <SIL> um <SIL> you have like the united negro college fund things like that <SIL> where <SIL> they're almost segregating themselves by having these organizations <SIL> because they're geared specifically towards black people <SIL> and <SIL> i think in a way that's almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community <SIL> because they're not giving out equal opportunity to the people that need em <SIL> um it's sort of like the same thing white people were doing <SIL> you know thirty forty years ago <SIL> where that they had they're <VOCNOISE> white organizations or what not <SIL> um and i think it's sort of going along the same lines where <SIL> there is still a problem of it but <SIL> i think it has gotten better at least <SIL> if nothing else <IVER>
um <IVER>
i think <IVER>
i think for the most part people could handle it <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> obviously i think probably more <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the <SIL> older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole <SIL> black rights movements and things like that <VOCNOISE> um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more <SIL> like <SIL> more the generations of today or whatever <SIL> like basically anyone under the age of about <SIL> forty or fifty or so <VOCNOISE> i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i don't think it caused any <SIL> huge problems or anything like that <IVER>
uh yeah <SIL> um <SIL> yes <SIL> and no they're kind of weird <SIL> like <SIL> that um <SIL> one set of grandparents <SIL> really i can't hear ever says anything <SIL> there's a set on the other side that <SIL> they are <SIL> a little bit more racist <SIL> um <SIL> but at the same <SIL> time <SIL> it i <SIL> don't know they almost set up like a double standard <SIL> for black <SIL> people <SIL> there are black people that they really like and i mean they're actually friends with some black people and there are black people that they don't like for whatever the reason may be <SIL> and <SIL> those are the people that they're racist towards <SIL> i mean it's the same thing that goes with <SIL> white people obviously there are white you can stand they're white people that are just <SIL> obnoxious and you don't wanna deal with <SIL> um i mean it's basically the same <SIL> thing <SIL> right <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah exactly <SIL> um <SIL> i really don't think we do for the most part <SIL> i can't say i <SIL> see any <SIL> real big problems or anything like that <SIL> that occur just <SIL> because of <SIL> the sex <SIL> you are or anything <SIL> i think that probably would've caused a bigger problem than the black <SIL> president <SIL> um honestly <SIL> um <SIL> although i don't really <SIL> see too <SIL> many sexist <SIL> problems i definitely do see <SIL> guys still be more <SIL> like the decision making <SIL> type <SIL> and as being like the final <SIL> say in things <VOCNOISE> rather than women <SIL> and i would see them <SIL> having an authority figure <SIL> that's being a woman <SIL> as causing problems to em <IVER>
i think they would a bigger problem with it yeah <IVER>
um <SIL> like i said it'd just be the old generations with the <SIL> black president <VOCNOISE> where now it'd be <SIL> part of all generations that would still have a problem with it and i think that'd be a bigger number <IVER>
then <SIL> would be with a black president <SIL> and i think it would cause problems <VOCNOISE> um i don't know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it <SIL> but <SIL> i definitely could see here <VOCNOISE> definitely <VOCNOISE> <SIL> would think that people would be <SIL> arguing about it yelling about it and <SIL> making a bigger deal about it <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> probably for the most part i mean <SIL> as long as they <LAUGH> have a <VOCNOISE> political background of some sort i can't say i see any <SIL> real difference <SIL> i mean for the most part they've proven to be able to do <SIL> anything else any <SIL> guy can do so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> not really <LAUGH> i mean <VOCNOISE> i don't think they'd come <SIL> to any more difficult conclusions than guys had <SIL> coming up to <IVER>
uh yeah <SIL> no not <SIL> at all <SIL> no <SIL> um honestly no <SIL> i'm <SIL> pretty shy for <VOCNOISE> the most <SIL> part so <SIL> those <SIL> more types of women i can't say <SIL> i <SIL> really <SIL> ever had a relation with or whatever <SIL> unfortunately although i don't like it <SIL> yeah <SIL> i don't know i just <SIL> i'm a pretty indecisive person i don't like making decisions <SIL> and she's kind of the same way <SIL> so when it comes to what we're going to do or whatever it <SIL> takes <SIL> us hours to decide <SIL> what we're going to do and i mean it just gets us <SIL> nowhere <SIL> i mean even some place <SIL> as simple as you know where to go out to eat or whatever we'll spend a good half hour forty <SIL> five minutes just driving around till we actually decide a place or someone <SIL> says something or <SIL> whatever <SIL> so <IVER>
what's that <IVER>
um i met her in high school <SIL> she's still in high school and i'm in college <SIL> so <IVER>
um <SIL> yes and no <SIL> i mean <SIL> as far as <SIL> the experience goes i mean i don't live on campus <SIL> so i don't get the entire <SIL> college experience you know <SIL> the whole dorms and events going place on campus <SIL> it's more things about pick and choose that i wanna do on campus i come down for <SIL> um so i can't really say it's anything too drastic <SIL> i mean obviously it's kind of weird when <SIL> people are asking what you're doing and you're like oh i'm going to <SIL> you know high school prom <LAUGH-or> something <VOCNOISE> i have parts a little <SIL> little awkward but i mean i can't say it <SIL> it's really any different or anything um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
i <SIL> honestly don't think that that really has much to do with it <SIL> obviously it does <SIL> put the idea in the kids' heads <SIL> but <SIL> it's been there for a long <SIL> time <IVER>
um <NOISE> i mean obviously i mean that's how little boys are or whatever <IVER>
i mean obviously <SIL> being <VOCNOISE> uh being a little boy i remember <SIL> i mean just <SIL> seeing even things like football or whatever i mean <SIL> it's you'd see something you thought it was neat so you'd do it or whatever <IVER>
i mean it goes back <SIL> more towards the curious nature of <SIL> kids <SIL> where i mean i can't say there's anything really different
