<SIL> she was but i had admired her more <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah because um <VOCNOISE> uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again <VOCNOISE> that's gonna be the litmus test <VOCNOISE> and it's just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party <VOCNOISE> they would nominate such people as uh mcgovern who hadn't yknow who i voted for but had no chance of winning <VOCNOISE> over the years i have moderated my <SIL> hardline left of center liberal stance <SIL> <VOCNOISE> for more of a moderate <VOCNOISE> middle of the road <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because it's easier to get that sold to the american public <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> while <UNKNOWN-guh> <SIL> i think dole was correct <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think she yeah she shot herself in the foot <SIL> i don't she would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is <SIL> being controlled by the extreme right wing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> which is a problem for the republicans they moved they need to move towards the middle <VOCNOISE> which i think george w is trying to do <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> uh <SIL> uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell i tell them yes and i'm an <CUTOFF-in=indifferent> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> an indifferent liberal <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if she could have become the candidate <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she might have been able to beat <SIL> <CUTOFF-r=??> <HES-I> i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but yknow <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> and in in election times <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a weekend <SIL> is a couple of centuries uh uh a year <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is an <SIL> eon <LAUH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> so anything can happen between now and then but <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> uh dole had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> which is basically where clinton <SIL> placed himself in the two elections he ran in <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> most real democrats the warren beatty's of the world and many <VOCNOISE> yknow congressmen <HES-and> and senators dislike clinton <VOCNOISE> because <HES-they> <CUTOFF-di=didn't> they didn't think he was democratic enough <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i liked clinton because as i said over the years <HES-uh> i've learned that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> extremes in either party don't get elected <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and that if you want someone <SIL> that has your <VOCNOISE> <SIL> general interest at heart you hafta find someone who's a moderate and can can appeal to everybody <VOCNOISE> i used to tell school districts when i went in to tell them how to to put together a school levy campaign that basically you had <VOCNOISE> the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my <SIL> age <VOCNOISE> but that there was about <VOCNOISE> thirty percent of the people who were <SIL> were for you <SIL> with the yes votes thirty percent who were automatically against you the no votes <VOCNOISE> and thirty percent in between <VOCNOISE> i told them ignore the no votes <SIL> yknow just <SIL> just don't get them upset with you you don't want them yknow working actively against you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lock up <CUTOFF-y=your> <VOCNOISE> your thirty that are with you make sure you <SIL> yknow you do something with them but <SIL> this group the the middle thirties i call them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you had to massage them <VOCNOISE> and that's what clinton did so well and that's what dole could have done i'm not sure if george w is gonna be able to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh because to get the the nomination eventually he's gonna come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i'm anti abortion <VOCNOISE> i'm pro gun he's already said the pro gun <VOCNOISE> and that's because it's going against <SIL> what most americans are saying <VOCNOISE> dole i think represented where most americans are if you look at opinion polls <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um so <CUTOFF-y=you> yknow you hafta find a way to <CUTOFF-m=moderate> to moderate that stance <SIL> uh whether you're republican or a democrat <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah <SIL> i think it's possible <VOCNOISE> it'd have to take the right combination <SIL> of uh someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people <VOCNOISE> i think dole would have been a good candidate i would have been hard pressed <VOCNOISE> i mean uh to some of her issues i don't like but <VOCNOISE> when she came out <VOCNOISE> uh and said her her her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns <SIL> uh she went up a <CUTOFF-n=notch?> couple of notches in in in my estimation because i wasn't sure where she'd be <VOCNOISE> i thought she'd have to sell herself as hardline with the hardline republicans <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then i wouldn't have been able to vote for her <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
except you couldn't come right out and say you wouldn't you didn't want to vote for her because she was a woman there'd have to be an under current <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed <SIL> they're the older citizens <SIL> um <SIL> many in my generation uh they'd just probably be <VOCNOISE> because <HES-I'm> i'm the early baby boom i'm i'm the first of the baby boom <VOCNOISE> uh and that's when the woman's movement started and many men there still haven't always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the <VOCNOISE> the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> there there's a a whole world of difference between their attitudes in a lot of things and <VOCNOISE> yknow women's minority issues uh they just second hand to them it it doesn't <SIL> yknow <SIL> it's <SIL> not <SIL> like it was for us which was a sea change <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for them it's normal <VOCNOISE> so and more of those people are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in the voting population <SIL> if they would vote <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yknow you'd have to find a candidate who would know how to do what clinton did in ninety two and get out that college vote <IVER>
that that um <VOCNOISE> that's an interesting question because he was a <CUTOFF-s=serious> <SIL> a serious contender last time i haven't heard his name this time <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> what people say they would do <CUTOFF-th=that> yknow that they like him <SIL> because he is um intelligent charismatic <VOCNOISE> uh all those <CUTOFF-th=those> those neat things that you need to <VOCNOISE> to be elected today <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and a lot of people said they would vote for him but what they say in polls they don't know if it would translate over but yeah i think he could <VOCNOISE> i think the right candidate could and i think mike coleman this year <VOCNOISE> uh in the columbus race showed that <VOCNOISE> i mean he crossed <VOCNOISE> gender lines he crossed <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> party lines he crossed over into all of the city <VOCNOISE> and winning even dorothy teater's <SIL> precinct which surprised me <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <HES-and_not> and not by just a little small margin i think it was two hundred and some votes which is pretty substantial <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-ri=right> well <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well teater's a school board member for columbus <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH-right> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's that's really hard to say um <VOCNOISE> if she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran <SIL> negatives don't work in columbus <VOCNOISE> columbus really does have a heart <SIL> and that just doesn't play <VOCNOISE> in columbus what plays in the state <SIL> and and the people who ran her campaign ran voinovich's campaign and <VOCNOISE> betty montgomery's campaign and and that negative stuff worked statewide <VOCNOISE> that doesn't work so well in columbus <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i i think that it'd <SIL> even a younger woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and i like to think that age doesn't matter but she came across as old to me also <VOCNOISE> and i like to think i'm not prejudiced on <SIL> on any issue but if there's uh <VOCNOISE> someone who had been right on the issues <SIL> i don't care if she was old i would have voted for her she just didn't support the issues i supported <VOCNOISE> she was wrong on <VOCNOISE> uh i i didn't like that she tried to use um the police chief <SIL> in such a negative way by saying that um <VOCNOISE> coleman had voted for a raise for the chief <VOCNOISE> well yes he voted for a raise for the chief but he voted for a raise for the the police <SIL> officers <SIL> it's just that yknow the police chief's was tied to his <VOCNOISE> and i don't like people who try to manipulate facts <VOCNOISE> uh and and that was manipulating the facts i didn't like that she was um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-ag=against> against <VOCNOISE> the the the tiff <SIL> uh and polaris once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong and i don't think it was wrong to begin with <VOCNOISE> but once it was voted and in place i thought our reputation was on the line and for her to try to use another divisive issue just to get elected <VOCNOISE> didn't sit well with me <VOCNOISE> um so i don't even if she had a lot of charisma <VOCNOISE> charisma doesn't mean as much to me <SIL> as a person's stand
