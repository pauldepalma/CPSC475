<SIL> and the thing that was always cool about my mom is <CUTOFF-tha=tha> <CUTOFF-uh=I> it was somebody that <SIL> wasn't real nice to <EXT-me> or that i didn't really like <SIL> she wouldn't have anything to do with them i mean the whole thing was yknow if i approve of this person <IVER>
then then that was always her main focus <IVER>
so that was real nice and i was her maid of honor when they got <LAUGH-married_it_was_just_it_was_well_of_course_about_this_big_but> <IVER>
but she always she always put me first and i think that that made it <VOCNOISE> a lot more positive for me <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> i would say <SIL> so <SIL> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> well i had to drive her down here last time so i didn't want to come back <LAUGH-I_didn't_want_to_come_back> if she has to come back i might as well go with her <VOCNOISE> i'm just kidding we went to get something to eat i dropped her off <SIL> and she took the bus home <SIL> <EXT-hum> we're talking about <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think that <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i don't think that divorce is a bad thing <VOCNOISE> i think that <SIL> <CUTOFF-it=it's> <SIL> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you're married <VOCNOISE> and <EXT-you> <SIL> realize that you get to a point where you and this other person <VOCNOISE> <EXT-are> are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family <VOCNOISE> that it's better to just say <VOCNOISE> look this is not <LAUGH-working> <VOCNOISE> we both deserve to be happy and we <CUTOFF-de=deserve> <HES-and> <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> go your own <LAUGH-separate> ways <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think that <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <SIL> i think for me personally <SIL> i would certainly <SIL> i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i wouldn't <VOCNOISE> end up getting divorced <VOCNOISE> just because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as like coordinating <LAUGH-things> and i know that sounds kinda petty <VOCNOISE> but just <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <HES-but> <SIL> <HES-I> <SIL> <HES-I> <HES-I> <SIL> i mean i don't think it's i don't think it's bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously <VOCNOISE> to continue to <HES-make> a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different <IVER>
yknow there's things about <HES-the> <VOCNOISE> my dad that <VOCNOISE> and i wouldn't want to live with <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> uh he's great and he's wonderful to me i mean <VOCNOISE> my dad is really wonderful to me <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean things like <VOCNOISE> like when my mom had me <HES-he> he didn't pick her up from the hospital <SIL> i mean it's that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> like i said he's great to me and and everything <VOCNOISE> but i wouldn't <SIL> i wouldn't want to be married to him <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow_I_certainly> wouldn't and would i expect my mom to stay with <SIL> with that in that kind of a situation <VOCNOISE> no way i would want her to be happy <VOCNOISE> and i would want my dad to be happy also <VOCNOISE> so ultimately for that situation <HES-I> think it was much better <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> they got married kind of young too yknow and i think that <VOCNOISE> i think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be <CUTOFF-m=more> a little bit more careful <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i know that <VOCNOISE> that now it's a lot different than it used to be <VOCNOISE> people would get married and <HES-uh> they'd just be expected to stay together and there's a lot of people that have been married <VOCNOISE> for a really long time and they're miserable <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yknow <HES-and> <VOCNOISE> what's the point of staying married and being miserable i think it's better to get a divorce than <IVER>
than to do that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
see <IVER>
i don't agree with that at all <VOCNOISE> i think if your parents are unhappy together <SIL> only thing that's gonna happen is it's gonna trickle down and you're gonna have to listen to them being miserable <VOCNOISE> <HES-and> and i think it's much more positive to have two families <VOCNOISE> that are happy than one family that's miserable and they fight and then you feel like it's your yknow people say it's a my fault because this happened <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger <VOCNOISE> then <HES-I> <SIL> i can't imagine being a teenager <SIL> and having my parents split up i think that that would be <SIL> probably very difficult <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> so i don't <CUTOFF-ne=know> that's a totally different perspective <HES-just> to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger <IVER>
<LAUGH-no_that's> not what i mean <VOCNOISE> no i <HES-don't> i don't mean it that way but i just mean <VOCNOISE> i think <ERROR-it=it's> i think it's better that if people are <CUTOFF-g=getting> <HES-are> get to a point where they can't work it out i mean i think that <VOCNOISE> that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and <VOCNOISE> and maybe there is some way to work it out <IVER>
but i mean if you get to the point <HES-where> you where there isn't then you just have to <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think you have to be in the situation in my situation i think for my parents <VOCNOISE> it's better that they split up because they're both very happy now <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum but i don't know if that's <VOCNOISE> i think that the divorce rate has gone up because it's more socially acceptable i'm sure there's plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have <LAUGH-gotten_a_divorce> <VOCNOISE> had that been an option <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <HES-I> i think it just <HES-I> think a lot of it is just depends on the way you handle it <SIL> yknow how you <VOCNOISE> how you handle it after after the <HES-the> divorce is final i mean not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> do you see <CUTOFF-wha=what> does that make any sense at all <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i mean <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> it is <HES-it's> <HES-it's> <HES-it's> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> it's a touch <SIL> i think it's <HES-I> think it's tough and i think it's really an individual basis <SIL> but i wouldn't <SIL> i would say that there's a lot of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> other things that are <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-th=that> that would contribute more to <HES-any> <HES-societal> problems than divorce i really don't think that that would be the main <IVER>
because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think the fact that things like <CUTOFF-ih=?> responsibility maybe a long time ago <VOCNOISE> people stayed <VOCNOISE> married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of <HES-of> <VOCNOISE> their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take <LAUGH-care> of your family <VOCNOISE> instead of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh yknow <CUTOFF-m=?> <SIL> things as far as people getting pregnant and <HES-and> then this person goes off <HES-and> and leaves and you've got a lot of unmarried <VOCNOISE> single women that are all by themselves and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> it's just it's more socially acceptable to <SIL> to be able to do these things now then i think it was a long time ago i mean <VOCNOISE> peoples' families wouldn't would never stand for something like that they'd say look you need to take care of this you need to deal with this and now it's just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's kind of normal and everybody just kinda goes along with it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
see <CUTOFF-i=it?> well if it doesn't if it doesn't work than i can <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well that's what my best friend amy said i'll get married and hell if it doesn't work i'll just get divorced <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-that's_a_great_attitude_to_have_Amy> <VOCNOISE> but i mean <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah_really> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i mean <HES-I> guess for me <HES-I> <SIL> i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just think jason and i get along so well <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow and <CUTOFF-w=we've> and we've been together for about two years and <VOCNOISE> i <HES-mean> <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i just <HES-I> do i just <HES-I> just really like him i don't <LAUGH-know_if_I'll_feel_that_way_in> <VOCNOISE> in ten years from now but it certainly <VOCNOISE> there's a lot of things <HES-that> that our families are very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> about different things <EXT-and> <HES-and> we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things you have to look at <VOCNOISE> from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> his name was jason too but <CUTOFF-h=he> <VOCNOISE> <HES-he> <VOCNOISE> he drank a lot <SIL> <IVER>
great guy <VOCNOISE> but he sure liked to get drunk <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> and the problem was he would turn into such a jerk <IVER>
yknow and i just <CUTOFF-though-thought> <HES-it?> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just don't <SIL> i just don't like this is not so is this something <HES-that> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i look long term is this something that i wanna deal with for the rest of my life and i said no it just isn't <VOCNOISE> yknow and i think that you have to look <CUTOFF-a=at> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and see if you're compatible with somebody <SIL> <HES-before> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow people get into situations and they marry people that you <HES-just> you've <SIL> from the outside you can look and you can think <VOCNOISE> are you nuts <SIL> yknow that is never gonna <LAUGH-work_yknow> so i think that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you just kinda hafta take into consideration yknow are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that's gonna <CUTOFF-be=be?> that's gonna work and be positive <SIL> yeah i don't <SIL> i don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm not old <LAUGH-enough_to_know_anything_yet> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a lot bigger <SIL> <IVER>
um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the things that i notice that are different <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i guess <CUTOFF-a=and> i mean <HES-if> you look like <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=as> as far as expansion obviously there's a lot of areas that that are developed now that didn't used to be <IVER>
<EXT-um> <SIL> <HES-I> <HES-I> certainly spent most of my time <HES-well> <SIL> in the areas that i grew up i mean i don't <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't really go over to the east side very <CUTOFF-o=often> very often yknow sometimes we'd go over yknow in highschool and drive and see if we could see a prostitute <SIL> yknow or something like that <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i <HES-don't> <SIL> i don't know <CUTOFF-wha=what> <SIL> as far as <VOCNOISE> i don't really keep up with statistics as far as the crime rate and those types of things i mean i don't know <VOCNOISE> if it's the media <LAUGH=uh_that's> <UNKNOWN> yknow <CUTOFF-kin=kinda> <SIL> portrays as there's more than there used to be <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i know that when i was younger i was allowed to <CUTOFF-d=do> to do a lot more things <VOCNOISE> uh by myself like to to go places on the bus <HES-and> and those types of things and <VOCNOISE> than my family's allowed to do now <IVER>
so i don't know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous <VOCNOISE> um but i think that comes with the <CUTOFF-b=bigger> with a bigger city when you get more people there's obviously gonna be <CUTOFF-wi=?> some more problems <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and uh i mean that's <HES-really> that's really all that i know so it's obviously a lot more build up it's gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and
