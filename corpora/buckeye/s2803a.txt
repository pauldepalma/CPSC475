<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-y=you_know> <CUTOFF-h=how> uh just how like too <VOCNOISE> how there's no real <SIL> <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> everybody conforms to their <SIL> own set of norms in each group yknow it's like <SIL> people <VOCNOISE> no matter like yknow even if ted kaczynski is out <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-oh> uh on <VOCNOISE> yknow wherever in like his little shed <VOCNOISE> yknow he's still a part of society like how you can't get <HES-away> from society and just how like <VOCNOISE> how society develops in general like how high school's like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> is kind of true to life but then really different too on how life is but just how <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just a <SIL> a more of a <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> more of a closeknit thing so it's more apparent how how segregation works or whatever <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> people that <CUTOFF-j=just> <SIL> just uh <VOCNOISE> really wanna teach as opposed to like i don't know why other people wanna <SIL> like <SIL> even went into teaching at all yknow <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> i think that would help just making it more like not so impersonal not so <VOCNOISE> this is <SIL> yknow you do this to get this certain grade it's like you do this to learn this because it's interesting as opposed to like <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i think it's like there's a lot of things that <VOCNOISE> it's more <VOCNOISE> like compulsory <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> education is weird <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> being forced to take this class like i think that if i uh but <CUTOFF-I> i mean it's good to being forced to take a <CUTOFF-bro=broad> like a liberal arts thing because like you don't know what you <CUTOFF-wa=want> <SIL> wanna do <VOCNOISE> so it's like if like you hate math and you don't take it at all but then you decide you wanna do something in math then you're like screwed like <VOCNOISE> can't go back <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> see i hate that like <VOCNOISE> all the work that you do is like reduced to like one letter <IVER>
and it's <CUTOFF-li=like> <CUTOFF-I> i like how <SIL> <VOCNOISE> see like i thought about going to antioch but it was it was really expensive and like <SIL> um i don't know <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> just because the <HES-and> and the school's <SIL> more of a <VOCNOISE> nontraditional <CUTOFF-ty=type> type where <NOISE> they give you <SIL> like evaluations and you don't get grades like and so <VOCNOISE> so then it <CUTOFF-l=like> <SIL> that's what that's what i heard it's like at antioch where the professor writes <VOCNOISE> uh like a couple page paper <VOCNOISE> on your <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> performance on the quarter and that that really shows that <VOCNOISE> i mean that's a lot of work for the professor but like <VOCNOISE> that really shows that he's really involved in noticing what you're doing as opposed to <VOCNOISE> just like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some kid in his class you <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
like <VOCNOISE> i'm not <CUTOFF-r=really> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm not really sure like how <VOCNOISE> they <SIL> how the interview works to become a teacher <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think it's like a lot of times <VOCNOISE> they're really desperate to find <EXCLUDE-people> <SIL> and so they really just <SIL> take whoever i mean <VOCNOISE> they're lucky enough to even <ERROR-f=have> have a body to fill the <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> place and they're doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean <SIL> sort of i mean <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-eh=I> i mean i <CUTOFF-g=guess> it's working well enough i guess i mean <LAUGH> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> like <SIL> people are learning things and like wanting to go on to college and stuff <IVER>
um <IVER>
i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> maybe <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> maybe if <VOCNOISE> teachers just their status in society isn't real high when it should be <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it's more <VOCNOISE> like i yknow i've heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers yknow and <VOCNOISE> how <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but it um <SIL> so it's just like <SIL> people always talk about yknow education for the <CUTOFF-ch=children> <VOCNOISE> yknow we gotta like <SIL> think about our child's future or whatever but <VOCNOISE> really teachers are <VOCNOISE> paid crap <LAUGH-and> like <SIL> don't really get a lot of respect from anybody <VOCNOISE> like professors and stuff get <CUTOFF-r=respect> <VOCNOISE> get <CUTOFF-r=respect> like <SIL> more of a respect but <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> it's just like <SIL> <ERROR-teat=teach> like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in <SIL> in your life like in <ERROR-chr=?> like especially in adolescence too like really influence like how you are as a person and like people don't <SIL> like take that for granted a lot <VOCNOISE> like if you have bad teachers in one subject you're gonna hate that subject <VOCNOISE> yknow and like if you have good teachers you're gonna love it i mean <VOCNOISE> that really <CUTOFF-in=influences> influences too like how <SIL> like what you wanna do with your life yknow <SIL> and people don't really <SIL> acknowledge that too much <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
<LAUGH> sometimes i think that it's just like math sucks and it's like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-that's> a like there's no there's not a lot you really you can really do with that <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <NOISE> yeah sure <NOISE> <LAUGH> no it's okay <IVER>
