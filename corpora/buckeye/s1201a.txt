<VOCNOISE> uh which is nice i've got <HES-a> a lot of support from everybody get <VOCNOISE> <SIL> gets good kind of confusing on holidays <IVER>

it's crazy because everybody wants to buy us <VOCNOISE> <SIL> everything yknow and i'm going oh my gosh and they're like just give me a list and somebody is like i wanna get this and i wanna get that so it's just <VOCNOISE> it's just been <LAUGH> <LAUGH-it's_been> something else which is <SIL> which is good though because our families are pretty similar and they're all <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
real positive about it but <VOCNOISE> basically i i lived here for <VOCNOISE> for my whole life and i grew up on campus and <IVER>

<CUTOFF-it=it> <IVER>
it's been <HES-a> i it's been a remarkably well i mean i haven't had <SIL> any problems i found out pretty early which was kind of strange in about <VOCNOISE> four weeks <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i went in <HES-and> and uh i had a check-up and my doctor he thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an ultrasound <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well the thing is they did this ultrasound they didn't find anything so <VOCNOISE> which was really kinda creepy because they didn't know because there's that whole tubule pregnancy thing and all this stuff and <VOCNOISE> and the guy that did my ultrasound wasn't my regular doctor and he's kind of <SIL> little <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-he=he's> he's just a little abrupt for me and he says <VOCNOISE> well yknow if this is what it is yknow you could have a lot of serious problems you could <EXT-die> and all this stuff and i said wait a minute <UNKNOWN> i'm not ready for this but <VOCNOISE> after <CUTOFF-w=we> <SIL> after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that <SIL> it's gone really well i mean <HES-uh> i just <SIL> i and i know we just finished our lamaze classes last night <SIL> and there were some women in there <SIL> they're huge i mean these girls can't even get off the floor and i just feel really <LAUGH-bad_for_them_so> <SIL> for me it's it's gone very very well i mean i haven't really had any problems <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well a little bit near the beginning and that was pretty miserable but it's been <SIL> it's been a while <LAUGH-from_there> so it that's not something that <VOCNOISE> that <CUTOFF-r=right> <SIL> right now i've had any <SIL> anything like that so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
really <IVER>
really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> oh <IVER>
really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-back_to_bed_rest_really> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right wow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
huh <IVER>
yeah i've <CUTOFF-got=gotten> i've <ERROR-gottenen=gotten> plenty of <LAUGH-peopuh=people> <LAUGH> it's funny jason's mom asks me <VOCNOISE> so is your mom gonna come and stay with <LAUGH-you_for_a_week> i said no <LAUGH> i told my mom she started laughing <VOCNOISE> because <HES-I> <SIL> i mean <HES-of> <SIL> of course <HES-uh> for her to come over and help out <SIL> is terrific but if she actually stayed at my house for a week i think we'd just kill <LAUGH-each_other> <IVER>
um about fifteen <LAUGH-minutes> my mom and i don't go to far <LAUGH-from_each_other_so> <SIL> but jason's gonna take the week off and everything so i think that we'll <VOCNOISE> we'll be able to do that <IVER>
o s u <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> well we didn't we didn't find out we had a <HES-um> <SIL> i don't know we figured we'd just wait and be surprised is that what you guys did <IVER>
yeah we had a <HES-ah> my mom has a friend that does ultrasounds <IVER>
at um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think it was mount carmel we went over the weekend <SIL> and we went there saturday morning and i've got this forty five minute ultrasound tape of the baby which is cute because <VOCNOISE> you can only see parts of it but you can really <CUTOFF-s=see> you can see its face you can see what it looks like and everything but i said i don't wanna know the sex <SIL> and it's so hard to <VOCNOISE> because we're looking of course we're going through this tape trying to see if we can see anything and you just <CUTOFF-kae=can't> you just can't tell i think she was real careful to make sure that <VOCNOISE> that we wouldn't be able to she says i know what it is but i said <VOCNOISE> um alright well just don't tell us so <SIL> so that was kinda neat then <IVER>
we've got girls names <VOCNOISE> so we've got either sydney or mackenzie for a girl <SIL> and then <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well thank <LAUGH-you> <LAUGH> i <CUTOFF-li=like> yeah i think <HES-I> think <HES-that> that we both <VOCNOISE> this <HES-I> think <CUTOFF-t=to> to collectively together i know jason likes sydney a little bit better <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> i don't know about boys names <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i just <VOCNOISE> well he said one like when i was about three months that we both really liked but that wasn't really names weren't really what we were thinking about then <IVER>
neither one of us can remember it <SIL> <LAUGH-so_I_don't_know> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
aw <IVER>
uh-huh <VOCNOISE> uh-huh <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i figure when the time comes we'll just have to figure it <LAUGH-out> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-right> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
aw that's nice <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh my goodness <IVER>
oh she's a cute <VOCNOISE> she really is really cute i mean i mean she's got big eyes and big fluffy cheeks <IVER>
she is she's adorable <VOCNOISE> how <HES-old> is she in this picture <IVER>
really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> goodness can't get away from her <LAUGH-can_you> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <IVER>
aren't you holding it <IVER>
oh the <LAUGH-top> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-you_lost_your_pen> <IVER>
hm <SIL> <IVER>
yeah i was <HES-and> because <VOCNOISE> where i was <CUTOFF-w=working> i was working at a <ERROR-grecruiting=recruiting> firm and we were doing we had a lot of business before <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> and <HES-I> <HES-was> i <VOCNOISE> was pretty sick during <HES-the> during the morning and afternoon part and basically <VOCNOISE> yknow we talked about it and <HES-I> just decided to go ahead and just take some time off <HES-and> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i also went back to school then too <SIL> so i figured i'd take that time off and i <HES-went> <HES-I'm> going to otterbein <VOCNOISE> to get my masters in education <IVER>
so we're kinda doing that and then i figure i'm probably gonna <VOCNOISE> wait tables at night <LAUGH> and and finish going to school during the day so <IVER>
i got a job <HES-at> at hyde park <VOCNOISE> so that'll <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> it's just amazing because the money's so good yknow you really can't beat it i only have to work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and whatever <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> hyde park <SIL> grill <VOCNOISE> it's uh <VOCNOISE> it's a restaurant it's up in dublin <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> i don't know i mean i <CUTOFF-d=did> <HES-I> did that all through high school and college and after i <CUTOFF-g=graduated> actually after i graduated from high school i managed a restaurant for about a year and a half <IVER>
so i mean <VOCNOISE> it's something <HES-I'm> i'm comfortable with <IVER>
the hours <CUTOFF-with=with> <VOCNOISE> because jason works during the day too so it will probably work out pretty well for us <IVER>
just wanna get <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i'm <VOCNOISE> figuring <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> middle of january <VOCNOISE> is my guess i'll go uh <VOCNOISE> school starts i think the fifth of january <SIL> and then i'm gonna go that <VOCNOISE> i don't know well i <CUTOFF-thi=think> it's weird because <HES-I've> had a job since i was fourteen <IVER>
and this is the first time in my whole life <VOCNOISE> that i haven't been working and it's just like <VOCNOISE> my mom and i go out to lunch and we go to breakfast <UNKNOWN> what'd you do today well <NOISE-let's> see i went to breakfast with my mom and then amy and i went to lunch and then we <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> <CUTOFF-we=went> actually i <CUTOFF-w=we> <SIL> we moved about <CUTOFF-f=four> three months ago so i've been kinda doing a lot of stuff at our place so that's nice i mean <VOCNOISE> had a lot of time to get everything wallpapered and painted <EXT-and> and just do all those kinds of things but <VOCNOISE> it's weird yknow because i don't have to get up in the morning and i feel guilty yknow he leaves at six thirty or seven and i'm going <SIL> bye <LAUGH> <LAUGH-have_a_nice_day_yknow_and_i'm> <VOCNOISE> still sleeping which is <VOCNOISE> right now is really good because i have a hard time sleeping at night <SIL> and after he leaves <VOCNOISE> it's wonderful because i <CUTOFF-s=sleep> can sleep in till about ten thirty and i feel a lot better <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-nothing_worked_out>
