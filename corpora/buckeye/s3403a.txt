we hear <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and now that's <SIL> the most newsworthy story out there <VOCNOISE> so i think yeah the press have a lot to do with it <SIL> the media <IVER>
well hide in your basement i guess <VOCNOISE> and <CUTOFF-I=I'm> i <CUTOFF-m=mean> but i mean what <VOCNOISE> you can <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not as an individual <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well see that's a problem <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> it's hard to find a balance between censorship and <SIL> yknow free flow of information <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and as long as people <VOCNOISE> i mean some people <VOCNOISE> like this information uh <SIL> jerry springer's still running <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> which i i actually kind of enjoy watching <LAUGH-once_in_a_while> when i get the <CUTOFF-ch=chance> <VOCNOISE> it's kind of <VOCNOISE> interesting to watch these <EXCLUDE-people> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but i mean <VOCNOISE> i mean where do you draw the line what people should see and not see <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i don't want somebody telling me i can see something or telling me what my kids can see <VOCNOISE> uh i that's my job <SIL> and if i don't wanna see something on tv i'll turn it off <SIL> if i don't want my kids to see something on tv <VOCNOISE> we'll i have an argument <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> it used to be easy when they were little yknow now <LAUGH> yknow <VOCNOISE> you're dealing with a a twenty one year old an eighteen year old is not as easy <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
you're much bigger <VOCNOISE> and you can control the thing and keep it away from her <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> yeah but <VOCNOISE> but i don't want somebody else telling me what <SIL> they can watch and not watch that's my job <VOCNOISE> but i don't know how you i mean the <SIL> the media <ERROR-per=?> supposedly i mean <VOCNOISE> may <VOCNOISE> not supposedly this may be the way it works the media presents this stuff and people watch it or read it <CUTOFF-ju=just> <SIL> or whatever they don't <VOCNOISE> but it's when it's like the constant barrage that this is what you get <VOCNOISE> the monica lewinsky stuff and <VOCNOISE> every day there was a new twist on the story that <VOCNOISE> or they announced that the news was that there wasn't a news twist <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> i don't care <SIL> but you couldn't turn it off because that's all that was on <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
well they are now in a sense <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> it's easier to <SIL> to go somewhere else i think on the web on tv if you have yknow like <VOCNOISE> four news <CUTOFF-cha=channels> <UNKNOWN> four local news channels and they're all saying the same thing <VOCNOISE> and emphasizing the same things there's no <SIL> choice there if you want the news you're gonna get it one way or the other but on the web you can go somewhere else <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> and yknow major newspapers are all over the web <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> you can pick and choose and you can see different <VOCNOISE> perspectives on the same story from different parts of the country and <SIL> i think you get a a wider view <SIL> yeah <IVER>
well yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh that was the monica lewinsky <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think it's been good i mean the economy has been very good <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> it seems like society seems to be <VOCNOISE> improving <VOCNOISE> yknow even though we talked about this <IVER>
crime and stuff <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the republican years and carried over <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but people have been better off financially <VOCNOISE> overall <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> and i and i don't think he's made anybody i don't i wouldn't say he's made any <UNKNOWN> major mistakes <VOCNOISE> policy wise well <SIL> yes the <VOCNOISE> his personal life <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> he's well <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
he's really just <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <SIL> yeah he just doesn't think through the implications of things real well in his personal life <IVER>
well <SIL> yeah he does back down too often <VOCNOISE> i think <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> you uh <SIL> well <SIL> yknow the well the health insurance didn't have a chance <VOCNOISE> i mean <CUTOFF-i=if> <VOCNOISE> no matter what position he took on the health insurance trying to radically change things it wasn't gonna get through congress <VOCNOISE> and so yeah he backed down but i would've liked to have seen something else happen to it <VOCNOISE> but it was also he i mean he gave up because it was <SIL> it was useless to fight it <SIL> he didn't think it wasn't gonna get through congress <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> why spin your wheels on that <SIL> i mean he raised the issue <VOCNOISE> it was clear that it wasn't gonna go anywhere <VOCNOISE> and maybe it'll <CUTOFF-c=come> <VOCNOISE> it's i think it's regrettable it hasn't come back <SIL> yeah but <SIL> he's <SIL> pretty much out of the picture now <VOCNOISE> as of this week <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the gays in the military <VOCNOISE> i mean they've always been there <SIL> <LAUGH> i really <VOCNOISE> uh they've always been there <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i don't have problems being around gays <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i never have my <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> have a brother in law who's gay my <VOCNOISE> son's godfather's gay <VOCNOISE> it's not a problem <SIL> um <IVER>
oh clinton's position on it <VOCNOISE> well he sort of backed down from what it was gonna be and then <SIL> just hoped that it would drop and <SIL> i mean what <VOCNOISE> what you hear and read lately is that it really hasn't changed much <SIL> uh <SIL> and it but again that's i think part of that too is society's not ready <SIL> on some level to accept that <SIL> i mean gays in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gay marriages and <IVER>
well uh <IVER>
was it was <SIL> they actually had a law or they <SIL> or was it referendum <IVER>
oh really <SIL> i hadn't heard that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> know it it uh <VOCNOISE> some of it when clinton has backed down i think i <VOCNOISE> sorta summarized what i just said is <VOCNOISE> yknow for the health <VOCNOISE> insurance and reform with that <SIL> all that health insurance <VOCNOISE> area <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yeah he backed down but it wasn't gonna happen <SIL> so he could keep <SIL> know the furor going for months and months or years <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> still nothing was gonna happen it was the wrong time <SIL> or <CUTOFF-mo=move> try to move on to something else <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i think it's regrettable it hasn't come back <VOCNOISE> like you said it's like <VOCNOISE> well i made the one attempt and didn't go anywhere so let's let it drop and <VOCNOISE> count for somebody else to pick it up well <VOCNOISE> clinton's in <SIL> lame duck it's <VOCNOISE> why can't he bring it back <IVER>
it's a good <CUTOFF-ti=time> i mean what are they gonna do <VOCNOISE> i mean he's been through enough hell on his personal life this can't be much worse i wouldn't think <VOCNOISE> uh and he does <CUTOFF-ba=back> he does back down i think too much on stuff like that <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's a <EXT-long> time <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> if they can't say it in three months they can't say it in eight months <IVER>
oh george oh <SIL> w <VOCNOISE> i don't know i haven't <VOCNOISE> really formed an opinion i can't <IVER>
i can't see a lot of substance <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then <VOCNOISE> sorta <CUTOFF-ba=backtracks> <UNKNOWN> not really backtrack it's just like it's not anything really firm <VOCNOISE> i mean with mccain and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was what <SIL> the points they wanted to make and that <SIL> i don't hear that coming from bush <IVER>
well i don't <SIL> i hear some of that from gore but not as much <IVER>
it'll be a <EXT-long> campaign <VOCNOISE> i thought it was interesting that <VOCNOISE> that gore suggested <CUTOFF-that> <CUTOFF-reco=recommended> suggested <SIL> two <CUTOFF-campai=campaign> two debates a week and i just can't imagine <VOCNOISE> watching two debates a week for months <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow> it's like <VOCNOISE> well <SIL> at least they could get things out into the open but <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> they have the chance but who wants to watch that much <VOCNOISE> who has the time to watch that much <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't think we need eight months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries it's just <SIL> too long <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> people start tuning out <VOCNOISE> and there's only so much you can say <VOCNOISE> yknow it's like the candidates
