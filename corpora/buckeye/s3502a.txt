<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE=brrr> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she couldn't <CUTOFF-uners=understand> accept the fact that you could just disagree with her <VOCNOISE> it had to be because she was black or she was an older woman or <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you couldn't just disagree <VOCNOISE> had to be a reason there <VOCNOISE> but fortunately <CUTOFF-m=my> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-shuh=she> she accused me of that in front of my boss who was black <SIL> who <SIL> didn't believe it <VOCNOISE> he knew better so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah it did and then she <CUTOFF-tuh=?> <VOCNOISE> but she was <VOCNOISE> kind of a gossip she went around talking to everybody trying to get them all support her and nobody would support her <IVER>
they'd uh heard it all before and they <UNKNOWN> <SIL> some of them had known me for a few years <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i was told <ERROR-lafter=after> i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there than anyone else <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i don't believe <LAUGH-that> <LAUGH> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i wasn't i was in <CUTOFF-manager=management> for about thirteen fourteen years and it wasn't bad where i was before <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> this management it was it was the whole department it was uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know what it was people they were always arguing and fighting it was just the whole <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> atmosphere like of that place and it was just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> people that i'd known for years and gotten along well with were just <SIL> they were different when they went in there they just changed it was just <VOCNOISE> it was just not a good place to work <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i think there's been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i really think <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> even though i <SIL> would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking him away from the <CUTOFF-otha=other> <SIL> the cousins <VOCNOISE> i mean they've the cousins have been stressing all along he needs family he needs family well there's not much closer family than your father <VOCNOISE> and that that that they love this country and this stuff well then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> accept the laws and follow them whether you <LAUGH-dont> agree with them or not <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-th=think> <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i it was very unfortunate the way it happened uh but i think the government should <SIL> <VOCNOISE> not <UNKNOWN> let it go on as long as it had <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
its the way i feel <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-wah=we> <VOCNOISE> we were talking about this at work one day and they said you know i'm <CUTOFF-su=surprised> <SIL> surprised you think that way because <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> tend to be a little left of center on most things <VOCNOISE> sometimes far left but <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i said now this isn't <VOCNOISE> i she said <VOCNOISE> seems like that would be the conservative view my opinion the conservative view is <VOCNOISE> they don't want him to go back to cuba <VOCNOISE> not to the communism or <VOCNOISE> but people i've talked to even <VOCNOISE> extreme conservatives <SIL> and liberals they all pretty much feel the same way that the ones i've <CUTOFF-ta=talked_to?> i haven't heard anybody <IVER>
that's accepted the other <VOCNOISE> the cousin's side yet <IVER>
right <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> yeah but it <VOCNOISE> the conservatives and liberals are all agreeing on this <IVER>
that's what <IVER>
i <VOCNOISE> it's not a presidential <CUTOFF-iss=issue> candidate issue as far as i'm concerned but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh yeah <IVER>
even my mother who is a <VOCNOISE> she said if nixon were running today she'd vote for him she's that much of a conservative <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> agrees with what's happened <VOCNOISE> but most people will say the same thing there should have been another way to get him out of there but <VOCNOISE> at this point i don't think there really was <SIL> a <VOCNOISE> a few months ago yeah but <IVER>
i think the news media have hyped it up too much really <VOCNOISE> i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that's <VOCNOISE> trying to escape from cuba to united states that's found at sea is immediately returned to cuba <VOCNOISE> whether you agree with it or not <VOCNOISE> that's the accord and that's what <CUTOFF-kee=?> that's what <SIL> castro's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's the premise he's operating on <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> you know and the news media they haven't really been <SIL> a <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ji=just> <VOCNOISE> they just <SIL> they haven't been real objective about it <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> you know like there two fisherman that <SIL> found him at sea you never hear about the other one because that this was on one <SIL> just briefly i heard on the news because <VOCNOISE> he thinks he should go back to his father <SIL> but you don't hear about him <VOCNOISE> there's three cousins two of them think he should stay <VOCNOISE> miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you don't hear about him <VOCNOISE> i was reading about him <VOCNOISE> news week or someplace <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> so i think the news media is not been <VOCNOISE> totally objective about this <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh sure <IVER>
i'm sure <VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
it's it's <SIL> it's more a <VOCNOISE> it tends to be more of entertainment <VOCNOISE> i don't remember that being that way thirty years ago but <SIL> it does now <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> that's something i've noticed in the local news particularly <ERROR-latrih=lately> they say exclusively on our channel and stuff <SIL> and it's usually not that big of a deal what they're talking about uh but they're making a big point that you heard it here first and <VOCNOISE> i mean if you hear it five minutes earlier on one station than another what difference does it make <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'm just kind of appalled what they put on the news anyway it's not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> usually what i consider news <VOCNOISE> it's lot a human interest stories and things like that which <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> nationals getting that way too they're all heading that way anymore <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> used to be an <SIL> analysis with the news you don't get that at all anymore <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> kind of the u s a today syndrome <IVER>
light news <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's why i read <VOCNOISE> tend to read the alternative newspapers and things because you do get a <SIL> different perspective it's <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> probably just as slanted <VOCNOISE> but it is different <VOCNOISE> you're right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh usually whatever ones i can find uh <VOCNOISE> hey you got <VOCNOISE> columbus alive and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just not quite that <IVER>
yeah the local ones more than anything <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
