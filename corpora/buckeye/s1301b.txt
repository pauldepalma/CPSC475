<SIL> um <SIL> to move forward in my life now what happened with the chill was yknow there was <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i had a friend that worked for them so they didn't know that and um <SIL> uh he told me that there was glass in the back <SIL> room that they were supposed to install were supposed to have installed that was five feet higher <SIL> three to five feet higher <SIL> and um <SIL> should have would have could have yknow if it was up i wouldn't have got hit <SIL> i mean there's no two ways about it <SIL> but <SIL> if i didn't get hit i wouldn't be where i am <VOCNOISE> now <SIL> spiritually so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't refute it as an accident <SIL> and most of the spiritual leaders and people i talked to <SIL> ah went through the catholic church because that was where i was raised and what i was raised and none of those people could provide me with any adequate things <SIL> terms of counseling i know they tried <SIL> i know they did the best that they could <SIL> but um <SIL> there's a lot of things that the catholic church won't like to admit that they're wrong on <SIL> and they are wrong <SIL> um <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they'll sit there and ask me to atone for my sins yet they won't atone for the sins of all the priests that are molesting children still to this day <SIL> and they protect them <SIL> and that's not right <SIL> and i'm very <SIL> very <SIL> uh <SIL> outspoken about that <SIL> so rather than banging my head on the wall to people who wouldn't listen i just decided to leave the church <SIL> i don't go there anymore the only time i've gone there was for <SIL> my nephew's baptism and my grandparents' funeral <SIL> and that's the only time you'll find me in there <SIL> yknow <SIL> i went to a wedding <SIL> too but it's difficult sitting in there <SIL> because of the way i follow now and uh <SIL> and actually seeing things for what they are <SIL> and it's frustrating not being able to explain that to people but that's okay <SIL> um <SIL> with the lawsuit ah we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they <SIL> had all that higher <SIL> taller glass back there over a year <SIL> so they tried to use the excuse their excuse was that they couldn't find the hardware <SIL> to install it <SIL> and uh given all the hardware stores that we have here and <SIL> the ability to over night freight things uh <SIL> if it was any kind of ah <SIL> special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country <SIL> there's no excuse <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so basically <SIL> yknow it came down to after <SIL> it came to a legal battle <SIL> which was ah i was not gonna back down <SIL> they were um <SIL> i was poor monetarily and they knew that <SIL> so they were using the legal system to wear me down <SIL> um <SIL> the first uh at the date of filing i mean <SIL> first of all it took <SIL> i had a statute of limitations was two years <SIL> uh i had an attorney in a law firm representing but they were dragging their feet <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill <SIL> yknow <SIL> and that they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet <SIL> even though i knew the guy so i just said well look i'm dissatisfied i'm gonna go find another attorney <SIL> so give me my file <SIL> see you <SIL> and i went shopping around for a new attorney <SIL> and it took me about <SIL> seven <SIL> before <VOCNOISE-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> pardon me <SIL> seven attorneys before i found one that was <SIL> adequate in terms of <SIL> knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a neurosurgeon and uh <SIL> he had experience and expertise in uh <SIL> bringing up <VOCNOISE> the uh <SIL> the differences uh <SIL> and the realities of of a brain injury <SIL> ah and the effects the lifelong effects yknow <SIL> so after <SIL> the two years we got in uh <SIL> just under the two years <SIL> so i mean <SIL> hell that would be what it happened in ninety three so <SIL> just under <SIL> december ninety five <SIL> uh <SIL> the day the last day <SIL> of ah <SIL> the statute running out we filed <SIL> so we got it filed <SIL> once it was filed the judge ah scheduled a hearing <SIL> and for whatever stupid reason <SIL> um <SIL> the soonest they could hear the case was one year from the date that we filed <SIL> so <SIL> you can see when you get <EXT-into> bed with yknow <SIL> and involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multimillion dollar lawsuit <SIL> or whatever <SIL> yknow any kind of lawsuit uh <SIL> the big boys get all the breaks <SIL> so <SIL> ah in my opinion the judge didn't wanna hear the case before then or maybe his docket was full but i'm saying <SIL> yknow there's no prioritization in the legal system <SIL> there are some things that uh should be addressed <SIL> soon <SIL> uh i shouldn't have to wait that long but <SIL> so then <SIL> came down to one week prior to the uh <SIL> hearing <SIL> and i got a letter from my attorney and he said that uh and also a phone call from the office saying that uh <SIL> um <SIL> that they uh <SIL> were filing a continuance <SIL> <VOCNOISE> which meant that uh <SIL> the judge granted them an additional year <SIL> of discovery <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> whatever the law says <SIL> yknow <SIL> the judge says he has to back it up <SIL> but <SIL> so that postponed the trial for another year <SIL> which pissed me off <SIL> yknow <SIL> but that's exactly what they were planning on <SIL> yknow <SIL> wearing me <VOCNOISE-down> like i said <SIL> knowing that i don't have the money to <SIL> throw in there and say hey <SIL> yknow <SIL> um <SIL> but <EXT-they> know full well that we had all the evidence that we had too <SIL> so <SIL> ah <SIL> that just postponed it for another year finally we got into uh <SIL> coming in and then they ah sent a letter saying they wanted to <SIL> meet <SIL> uh for arbitration <SIL> to see if they <SIL> we could hammer out some kind of settlement <SIL> couple months before the trial <SIL> uh i was unaware of this common practice but yknow <SIL> it was very <SIL> iffy situation <SIL> um juries here <SIL> uh in columbus have been mm <SIL> ultra conservative <SIL> uh they feel that people for some reason or another <SIL> that people that have been legitimately injured and their lives have been affected that they don't deserve money <SIL> for whatever reason <SIL> um <SIL> and it <UNKNOWN-and_I> don't think it's fair <SIL> that they can sit back and be that conservative if it hasn't happened to them <SIL> i don't think that's fair <SIL> um <SIL> because it does affect your entire <CUTOFF-lay=life> <SIL> has <SIL> otherwise i'd be full time employed <SIL> i'd be gainfully employed making money and i'm not <SIL> and that's <SIL> that's not because of anything <SIL> uh <SIL> it's by choices on my part but it's <SIL> it's uh <SIL> you know there's a lot that <SIL> there's a lot there <SIL> the betrayal that i've had to struggle with there's a lot there that <SIL> um <SIL> yknow i felt i've been betrayed <SIL> by everybody that taught me <SIL> i feel betrayed by the the government <SIL> by the legal system <SIL> by the politicians by all the people that have been put in charge <SIL> to protect people <SIL> to protect ideals <SIL> to protect principles <VOCNOISE> throw it out the window for money <SIL> and then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt <SIL> um <SIL> it got down to just <SIL> ah dollars and cents <SIL> bartering <SIL> for what my life was worth <SIL> and it's <SIL> the bidding started at a hundred twenty five thousand dollars <SIL> i feel i'm worth more than that <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i feel like you can't put a value on a human life <SIL> um <SIL> yknow there were just subtle things that yknow my <SIL> sense of <ERROR-s=smell?> <SIL> taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half <SIL> ah <SIL> just all the trauma that goes involved with it not just <SIL> not just the physical trauma i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength <SIL> uh i wasn't killed <SIL> yknow <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so the physical <SIL> burden i was still dealing with a lot of the physical pain <SIL> uh it's gotten significantly less <SIL> but <SIL> uh the emotional pain <SIL> was worse <SIL> and is worse <SIL> um having to <SIL> have a <SIL> yknow a lack of money now <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> means lack of socializing means lack of going and doing things <SIL> um <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> don't have any <SIL> <VOCNOISE> lot of relationships don't have <SIL> a girlfriend don't have a wife don't nothing like that i've got a dog <SIL> a golden retriever <SIL>
