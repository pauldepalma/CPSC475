and the battle at fallen timbers <VOCNOISE> here's my i rough draft <VOCNOISE> would you fix it for me before i make my final copy so i'll get a good grade <VOCNOISE> see <CUTOFF-I=I> i tell them i said <NOISE-that's> what i'm here for <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i'm here to help you <SIL> use me <VOCNOISE> to help you get better grades <VOCNOISE> use me to run interference <VOCNOISE> if you think you know the science <VOCNOISE> but you're getting marked down because you can't spell the words <VOCNOISE> let me know i'll go talk to your science teacher <VOCNOISE> tell her not to count your spelling <SIL> or not <SIL> yknow not to make you take the test without the little spell checker thing that's in your book bag <VOCNOISE> to let you use that i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i do a lot of um <VOCNOISE> what i call advocating for my kids with the regular ed teachers that don't understand <SIL> i go in and i say well <VOCNOISE> yknow this is kind of a long test <VOCNOISE> could he maybe take half today and half tomorrow <VOCNOISE> or <SIL> would you mind if he came out to my room <SIL> ninth period during study hall <VOCNOISE> because i have a free <NOISE-period> and i could <SIL> like kind of monitor it and <VOCNOISE> and read the words he doesn't know so that he's actually answering what the question really says <VOCNOISE> instead of what he thinks it says <VOCNOISE> so that you won't be testing his reading ability but you'll really be testing whether he knows about magnetism <IVER>
oh <IVER>
<IVER>
oh yes they're getting better though they really are <VOCNOISE> they're much better now than they were twenty years ago <VOCNOISE> because <NOISE-the> trend is <SIL> <NOISE-to> <NOISE-keep> these students in the mainstream as much as possible <VOCNOISE> so teachers are having to learn <VOCNOISE> to <VOCNOISE> for example <IVER>
yeah how to modify <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> i give <SIL> in services all the time at my school for the regular ed teachers and i show them <VOCNOISE> they go well that's gonna make more work for me and i say how is telling the student to do every other problem <VOCNOISE> instead of all forty of them gonna make <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
i'm <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> so <SIL> or <SIL> how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an eighty i q for example <VOCNOISE> and you know he's not gonna get all the details and the battles and the years and the <VOCNOISE> captain's names but <SIL> you just want him to get the overall gist of the french and american war was about this time uh <CUTOFF-p=period?> <VOCNOISE> in history and this was the result and this is how long it lasted <VOCNOISE> just the main concepts <VOCNOISE> well there's the kid that you say <SIL> todd <SIL> you study for the test and when you come in i'll let you answer anything on the test you know <SIL> and anything you don't know you leave blank <SIL> and i'll just grade what you put down <IVER>
now that doesn't make any extra work for the teacher <SIL> but <SIL> it gives him a shot <SIL> he usually will answer <SIL> the concepts he'll usually answer the main stuff that he knows <VOCNOISE> and if you only grade him on that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he might have a shot at a c or a b <SIL> i mean there's <SIL> all kind of ways to modify <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-r=reduced?> <SIL> give a reduced work amount <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh give a kid a copy of another students notes if his are crummy and he <CUTOFF-k=can't?> can't study from them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we even have a thing at our school <SIL> that <SIL> it's <SIL> it looks just like notebook paper <VOCNOISE> and it's got the three holes and the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk <VOCNOISE> but it's <SIL> n c r <SIL> yknow the <SIL> two copies <SIL> <IVER>
you write on the top <IVER>
n c r paper <VOCNOISE> so when you write on the white copy it comes through onto the yellow copy <VOCNOISE> and at the end of the period <VOCNOISE> the student just rips off the back copy and hands it to his friend <SIL> so he didn't have to write <SIL> yknow if he wasn't getting the notes <IVER>
<SIL> and he didn't spell them and he couldn't read them later <VOCNOISE> nobody has to know that <SIL> so and so went down the hall and made a copy of so and so's notes on the xerox machine for the dumb kid <SIL> yknow <SIL> you just <SIL> yknow you just <SIL> say to one <SIL> student that sits in the front that's usually a girl <VOCNOISE> who usually yknow writes really neat and gets it all <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> just go suzy would you <VOCNOISE> use this paper today <VOCNOISE> because we're gonna review for the test <SIL> and then at the end of the period <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when the kids are leaving <SIL> and give johnnie a copy of it <SIL> the back copy would you do that for me <SIL> well the girls usually write neater <SIL> and they usually get <SIL> a girl that doesn't have a learning disability they usually get everything down off the board <VOCNOISE> whereas the boys <NOISE-will> get a little distracted <VOCNOISE> or they'll <SIL> yknow maybe not <CUTOFF-si=sit> <SIL> they don't tend to sit up front <SIL> they'll sit in the back so they can <SIL> yknow <SIL> jab their friend with a pencil and <VOCNOISE> throw the <CUTOFF-f=?> <SIL> paper wads and stuff <SIL> <IVER>
so <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> almost always <VOCNOISE> doesn't matter what <SIL> um the disability is <SIL> <LAUGH-and> <LAUGH-I> don't know why this is <VOCNOISE> but they used to say eight to one <VOCNOISE> now they're saying more like five to one <VOCNOISE> doesn't matter if it's a speech impediment <SIL> blindness retardation <VOCNOISE> cerebral palsy deafness <VOCNOISE> learning <CUTOFF-disa=disability> you name it <SIL> there's <CUTOFF-a=always?> <SIL> five to one more boys than there are girls <SIL> and we don't <SIL> know why <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
well deafness for example uh and blindness are not always genetic <VOCNOISE> they don't know why <SIL> they just know that <ERROR-thit=that_it> <SIL> shows up more in boys than girls <SIL> this year i don't have <VOCNOISE> one i have sixteen students <SIL> and i don't have one girl <SIL> fact i haven't had any girls for a couple of years <SIL> i usually have one or two girls and all the rest boys <SIL> but <IVER>
oh <IVER>
they're not as many of them or <SIL> you mean because <IVER>
well um <SIL> in the lower grades i believe that they are because <SIL> i think they should have some male <SIL> role models <IVER>
the lower grades <SIL> we have a few <SIL> male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many <VOCNOISE> but i think <SIL> that <SIL> young men <SIL> young boys would do better <SIL> in a <SIL> setting in school if they had a <SIL> a man earlier on <SIL> rather than having to wait till <VOCNOISE> they're in middle school <SIL> to relate to a coach <SIL> and up until then it's always been a woman <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
don't go into elementary ed that much <IVER>
that often <SIL> they do but <VOCNOISE> there's just not near as many of them <SIL> i can count on one hand the number of <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-m=men> um <SIL> men teachers i've known over the years in elementary ed <SIL> practically <VOCNOISE> yknow five <SIL> maybe six <SIL> that's that's probably why the boys don't <SIL> yknow <SIL> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
really <SIL> and it's a fun job it really is i <CUTOFF-n=?> i've only ever known one male <SIL> that taught first grade <SIL> and i knew one guy that taught third <SIL> most the time if they go in to elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> i really think that <SIL> if we let <SIL> the boys be more exposed to men earlier <SIL> then <SIL> they would <SIL> be more motivated to learn <VOCNOISE> because they would see that it's not just a girly thing <VOCNOISE> they would say oh well mister so and so thinks it's important that i know this <SIL> and he's a real macho guy so i better learn it <SIL> yknow <SIL> i do i really do <SIL> nowadays <SIL> with the pay <SIL> being better <SIL> we are getting more men <SIL> but <IVER>
in most <CUTOFF-ci=cities> <SIL> in most <CUTOFF-area=areas> in most school districts it's <VOCNOISE> comparable to <SIL> any other job now it used to always be low but <VOCNOISE> like a <SIL> beginning teacher in worthington starts at i think twenty six <SIL> eight <SIL> or something <SIL> course worthington's <SIL> one of the <SIL> three highest paid districts in ohio <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> it used to be that <VOCNOISE> teachers <SIL> just got paid <SIL> lower than a <CUTOFF-f=fireman> <SIL> starting fireman or starting policeman and <VOCNOISE> yknow you in a sense you're out there risking your life everyday too <IVER>
now that kids are carrying knives and guns and <VOCNOISE> things to school you never know if you're gonna walk into the building and <SIL> and maybe not go home that day <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> people say <VOCNOISE> things like <SIL> oh i wish i had a job where i got three months off every summer <VOCNOISE> and i'm just i hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store and i just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say <VOCNOISE> yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game <VOCNOISE> i was grading papers at the kitchen table <SIL> yknow <SIL> and if i go out of town on the weekend <SIL> i have to take my school bag and all my work with me <VOCNOISE> it never ends <SIL> yknow i put in about seventy hours a week during <SIL> the time of the year when i do teach <VOCNOISE> and by the way it's not three months anymore <SIL> you work for a week after the kids get out of school in june <SIL> which usually <SIL> puts you at about the twelfth to the fifteenth of june <SIL> school starts back the twenty third of august <SIL> at least in worthington it did <SIL> and you have to be back a week before that <SIL> so they've shaved both ends of that off till it's <SIL> it's like <SIL> <NOISE-ten> days in june <SIL> and maybe <VOCNOISE> fifteen days in august <SIL> and all of july <SIL> so <SIL> and then you spend some of that time going to seminars <VOCNOISE> and upgrading your certificate <IVER>
taking classes <VOCNOISE> hopefully <SIL> that's when you go to the dentist <EXT-and> yknow you catch up on all that stuff too <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <SIL> right if you're lucky <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but i mean <SIL> there's the person that says that and then there's the other person that says <SIL> oh i sure admire what you do and i wouldn't be a teacher for anything in this world <LAUGH> yknow and the the one that's just in awe of you <IVER>
and then there's the one that's like i wish i had two weeks off at christmas <VOCNOISE> well i used to work at harding hospital as a teacher <SIL> when <SIL> um <SIL> i first went to worthington when i said i got another job <SIL> i got <SIL> a job <VOCNOISE> <SIL> working at harding hospital as the <SIL> i was the principal <SIL> but i was also a teacher so i taught part of the day <VOCNOISE> and i was also the administrator <VOCNOISE> because they had a small school there for the kids that were in the adolescent unit <VOCNOISE> and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credit somewhere <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> the doctors always used to <SIL> we were on the <VOCNOISE> like each <SIL> person would be on a team <VOCNOISE> of these kids that would be assigned to these kids <VOCNOISE> and you'd go to your team meetings and the doctors <SIL> the <CUTOFF-s=shrinks> shrinks would go <VOCNOISE> i wish i got two weeks off at christmas yknow they'd be bitching and moaning about the fact that <VOCNOISE> that we got time off and they didn't <SIL> <LAUGH-and> <LAUGH-I> finally come up with the perfect thing one time i said well doctor simpson or whatever his name was doctor brown <VOCNOISE> you know how it is some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off <IVER>
<SIL> he never said a thing again <LAUGH> like oh okay we went for the big bucks <VOCNOISE> we went for the time off <SIL> everybody makes their choices <SIL> now you got to live with them <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> these kids don't get well just because it's the holidays <SIL> <UNKNOWN-well> you guys should stay here and work along with us <VOCNOISE> yeah right <SIL> we should also get <NOISE> a hundred and twenty five bucks an hour like you guys do to <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh i'll come back <SIL> i mean <SIL> if you need me to <IVER>
<SIL>
