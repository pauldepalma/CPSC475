<IVER>
yes <SIL> mm-hmm <VOCNOISE> yep <IVER>
no <IVER>
<SIL> mm-hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
yep <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <SIL> wow <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
wow <SIL> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-w=well> yeah <IVER>
no i <CUTOFF-ha=had> we actually had student tickets that <SIL> people didn't want clear up in c deck <SIL> um <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but we enjoy it because <HES-we> lot times we walk and <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> i think i was at that penn state game i have a <VOCNOISE> <EXT-cousin> is a golf pro over <SIL> near <SIL> penn state <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> trying think the name of it <SIL> um <SIL> but he usually gets us tickets for that game <IVER>
yeah <SIL> mm-hmm but i've never been to happy valley i've always <SIL> wanted to go i've heard it's so nice <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you <EXT-know> <SIL> <NOISE> they're such good people every time they come here to ohio state though they were very <SIL> you know high class people and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a year that we just <NOISE> killed them here i think it was <SIL> three years ago and but they were <VOCNOISE> yknow i mean though <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they just seem very gracious because <IVER>
i think their coach is the best joe paterno is the best <SIL> <IVER>
i do he's a <IVER>
he is <IVER>
he is <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
john no <IVER>
he he's a very he's a disappointment <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> i <IVER>
think the <LAUGH-main> problem with this year was the coaching it's good that they got rid of two coaches but <VOCNOISE> his attitude i just don't think the kids <SIL> think of him as a role model and i think a coach has to be a role model <VOCNOISE> i used to work at the hyatt <SIL> on capitol square <IVER>
and that's where <VOCNOISE> the ohio state players <NOISE> i don't know if you know this <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> they stay there every night before a game <SIL> i mean it's the most expensive hotel in columbus <VOCNOISE> all the players stay there but <SIL> to my amazement they come down for a uh <VOCNOISE> i think they have a dinner then they come down for a midnight snack it's so funny all these guys come down in their shorts and stuff <IVER>
to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice <VOCNOISE> but <NOISE> but then here comes <SIL> the uh cooper's wife <SIL> and his daughter <SIL> and like his son and i'm <NOISE-thinking> <NOISE> they're putting <CUTOFF-ah=all> <SIL> all these his family up in this hotel the <NOISE-night> before a game i mean <VOCNOISE> i don't know i just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when all <SIL> none of those boys get to bring anybody you know what i mean <IVER>
and none of the other coaches did either <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but i just thought it and here they came down for the midnight snack too <SIL> and i thought <SIL> this is for the <SIL> team <SIL> you know what i mean <IVER>
i thought it was very strange <SIL> but um <IVER>
he seems pretty arrogant i don't think he's done <NOISE> very <NOISE-really> too much for columbus <SIL> they need to get a younger coach they need <SIL> <VOCNOISE> a new <IVER>
they do because he just <SIL> he's all out for <NOISE-himself> <IVER>
i just really think he is <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i know it <IVER>
and then the players said we're not getting any guidance from the coaches <IVER>
you know and they some of them <VOCNOISE> spoke out where they should speak out <IVER>
yknow <SIL> mean i liked earl bruce <SIL> and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at <VOCNOISE> he was the nicest man and when they did that i don't know if you know about that when they <VOCNOISE> fired him the day before the michigan game <VOCNOISE> for having a nine to three season three years in a row <VOCNOISE> they fired him the day before that game <IVER>
and then but the whole band and the cheerleaders went to his house <VOCNOISE> and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart wrenching <IVER>
and because of that <SIL> the um <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> athletic director that was here at the time <SIL> he quit <NOISE> because he did not want to fire them and they overruled him <IVER>
but <IVER>
the city just could not believe <IVER>
that they fired him like that the night before the <VOCNOISE> michigan game <VOCNOISE> so then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora yknow a hat <VOCNOISE> he looked so cool <VOCNOISE> yknow because joe paterno he always wears a tie i don't know he just <SIL> he he's a great coach <IVER>
yknow not that what you wear makes you but he just <VOCNOISE> he's a good role model <IVER>
cooper just <VOCNOISE> i just don't see him ever <VOCNOISE> hugging the guys or saying great job or anything <VOCNOISE> you know <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well the main thing is <SIL> they never leave <SIL> they don't they go a lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest <SIL> g p a of any college <IVER>
i mean that is an <IVER>
that is an embarrassment for a college this size <IVER>
and they have excellent <IVER>
professors and everything <VOCNOISE> but i think <SIL> yknow they get a lot of these kids and they don't care about school <SIL> but they <VOCNOISE> they leave early <VOCNOISE> because they know they can do it <IVER>
and that's so sad for our city <IVER>
it really is <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
and these guys have a free ride and then they just leave on it <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i think they should too <SIL> i do <SIL> i <NOISE-really> do <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you're right that's not fair because then that's <SIL> that's a waste <IVER>
um because there is some good athletes you look at colleges especially on the west coast like stamford i have a friend who's <SIL> from california <IVER>
his dad's a <SIL> um <SIL> a graduate of stanford <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but he is um <SIL> they they never leave there i mean that's an excellent medical school and everything but those football players they're smart they they don't <SIL> they don't quit <SIL> yknow <SIL> i mean it's amazing they <VOCNOISE> they never do <IVER>
because they like it they like school and that's why they came to college football was secondary <IVER>
but here <VOCNOISE> it's just to see yknow <VOCNOISE> how much <SIL> success you can have and then <VOCNOISE> they just want to leave <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> we looked we can look forward to the basketball season i think he's a good coach <IVER>
we needed that <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah that was very exciting <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i think it was <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i know <LAUGH> <IVER>
well because <SIL> yknow <IVER>
but then they have one injury <SIL> and then <SIL> what are they going to do <NOISE> and they got to think of that <SIL> they have a free <SIL> education and they just don't think of it that way <SIL> yknow they think they can make enough money <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
money's not everything <VOCNOISE> it's too bad sports have <VOCNOISE> ended up this way <IVER>
it does <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i know <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <SIL> i think all through growing up there's always been <SIL> yknow <SIL> different kind of kids <IVER>
i mean there's always been the nerds and <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know when i was growing up <VOCNOISE> in the seventies <SIL> there really wasn't <SIL> punk or anything like that <SIL> and <SIL> i think um <SIL> unfortunately <SIL> i mean there's always going to be all different kinds of people <SIL> to make the world but <SIL> it they just <SIL> pushed you to an extreme <VOCNOISE> certain <SIL> kinds of kids and yknow <SIL> they want a <SIL> i saw <VOCNOISE> yknow i watch all these shows dateline and twenty twenty and all this informative shows <SIL> and how one was <SIL> in texas run over <SIL> one of the punk kids was run over by a <SIL> um <SIL> a jock <IVER>
i mean actually run over and killed <IVER>
um in a fight <SIL> and they just said that we wanna be <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> looked at as just <SIL> other <SIL> kids yknow in high school <SIL> but yet when they wear make up and they spike their hair <VOCNOISE> and they have all these piercings <SIL> yknow it's like they <CUTOFF-n_ah=?> <VOCNOISE> they don't want to be like everybody else <IVER>
yknow they want to be judged as like everybody else <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i think um <SIL> they have so many different ideas <VOCNOISE> and not that either one of them's right but still um <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> i think there's always going to barrier there <SIL> they're just kids are just not all kids are going to get along <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i mean <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
i think because <SIL> of the movies <VOCNOISE> and i think of <VOCNOISE> nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does <VOCNOISE> spark things in little <SIL> children's minds and even yknow like in junior high that oh yeah we could do that <SIL> yknow and <VOCNOISE> there's just so much violence <SIL> in <SIL> when we were growing up there wasn't any violence <VOCNOISE> on tv we weren't allowed to watch it <SIL> but yknow i mean i <NOISE-mean> the comics weren't violent um <SIL> now it's too open for kids the parents <SIL> yknow they say the parents should monitor <VOCNOISE> them
