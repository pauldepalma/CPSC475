<VOCNOISE> if they hold yknow enough of my views <SIL> i'm not gonna vote for a woman <SIL> just because they're a woman <SIL> and i'm not gonna vote for a democrat just because they're a democrat <SIL> they better have <UNKNOWN> uh yknow at least and <CUTOFF-I=I> and i don't need a hundred percent <SIL> uh so that a agreement with my views but i'd like they'd be at in the ninety to ninety five percent range <SIL> um but <SIL> yeah uh i'll uh i don't tend to vote straight party line either <SIL> as i said i've i've moderated from when i was <SIL> uh <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> college <SIL> to today part of the the aging process and <SIL> also partly because <SIL> i've <SIL> i've noticed that to get things done you hafta have a center <SIL> and it's the center that tends to rule <SIL> when i was in college <SIL> um <SIL> we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it <SIL> and some of the construction people in dayton came out with one that said america love it or leave it <SIL> uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it's america love it <SIL> and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you don't let them <SIL> yknow have bad manners at the table and you don't let them run around with the wrong yknow kids and you want them to behave well <SIL> yknow that's how i see america now and <SIL> and america's become more centrist <SIL> uh and when it <SIL> deviates from that either way that's when people become upset <SIL> um <SIL> so i just think it's important and i <SIL> i remember when um <VOCNOISE> who was the other president that i voted for that won <VOCNOISE> carter <SIL> uh <SIL> black leaders would meet with him once a week and then they'd come out and hold this press conference and complain about he didn't do this for blacks and he didn't do <CUTOFF-th=that> enough for blacks he didn't do this and he didn't do that <SIL> and i used to say <CUTOFF-so=some> to some my black friends <VOCNOISE> don't you see what you're doing don't you see that greater implications of this <SIL> oh no we need to have him move faster i said <SIL> yknow that'd be great <SIL> in an ideal world this isn't an ideal world <SIL> you hafta take it a step at a time whether you like it or not <SIL> <SIL> i said what you're gonna do is you're gonna make it look like he is so bad in all the issues you're gonna give people a reason to vote against him <VOCNOISE> then if any big issue comes up <VOCNOISE> that's just gonna be added to everything else <SIL> i said what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and praise him and that he's doing a good job and that we're moving along steadily <SIL> uh and i yknow i don't think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means <SIL> um i made that mistake when i was president the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy passed <SIL> so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all the leaking <CUTOFF-w=walls?> yknow <SIL> uh ceilings all of the peeling floors all the the bad chalk boards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff <SIL> and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said we're not gonna support those <SIL> and they voted no <SIL> so the next time we did an opposite track we went in and we said yknow um the <VOCNOISE> eighteen months later when the board put <ERROR-anoder=another> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-bal=balance> <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-v=vote> <SIL> levy on the the ballot <SIL> we said these are great schools we have great teachers look at this kid he's learning to read he's made six months improvement in three months and all that kind <SIL> <CUTOFF-ima=image> it was <SIL> image <SIL> and it we were saying the same thing yknow we want to continue this we want to make even this better <SIL> um <SIL> we learned to say the negatives in a positive way and that's important <SIL> yknow and and you need to get that <CUTOFF-c=center> that <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=you> you need to appeal to the center <SIL> american's don't like extreme <SIL> liberals they don't like extreme conservatives <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-th=they> they want <SIL> they want peace <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
i think it's the right <SIL> position to take <SIL> um but it <SIL> it like abortion that's one of the the big <CUTOFF-i=issues> <SIL> issues that divide people very quickly <SIL> uh i think it's moderating somewhat <SIL> uh as the gay activists continue their campaigns <SIL> um but that's one where a candidate has to tread very carefully <SIL> um i was proud that coleman said it and didn't <SIL> and didn't back down on that <SIL> um they <SIL> told me a little bit about his character <SIL> um <SIL> i don't know that i can answer your question straight forward because <SIL> i believe in gay <CUTOFF-ri=rights> <SIL> i believe in anybody's rights <SIL> <UNKNOWN-I_don't_know?> <SIL> what happens between consenting adults in a bedroom is their business not mine <IVER>
<EXCLUDE-right> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not if he'd been as open about it <CUTOFF-a=as> as he was here <SIL> um <SIL> yknow clinton did that also and and thought he'd be able to <SIL> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-segre=segregate> or not segregate desegregate the uh the the military and found out with his first <SIL> action <SIL> as president that <SIL> there there's a strong backlash against that at least nation wide and and and in the military <VOCNOISE> but i thought it was the right stance <SIL> um <IVER>
because it's more open <SIL> um <SIL> and you couch it in terms of civil rights <SIL> um <SIL> my boyfriend's <SIL> thinks it's wrong morally <SIL> but doesn't think we ought to be discriminating against <SIL> uh he he thinks it's a sin <VOCNOISE> therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through yknow talking to them religion wise <SIL> um <SIL> i don't think it's a sin i think that <SIL> um your sexuality <SIL> is genetic based <SIL> and that <SIL> i <SIL> you can no more change <SIL> your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put a different <SIL> um <SIL> whatever those <VOCNOISE> eye <CUTOFF-p=pieces> pieces are <SIL> contacts <SIL> i don't wear glasses so i can never remember those terms <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> but that's just cosmetic <SIL> <SIL> and anyone who tries to change their sexual orientation that's cosmetic too <SIL> uh <SIL> and again <UNKNOWN-whyuh> my belief is whatever happens between consenting adults is their business not mine <SIL> um <SIL> so i don't know that <SIL> anyone could change it <UNKNOWN> <SIL> what was your question again <IVER>
why people <IVER>
because of the gay activism <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah i was gonna say most them are <IVER>
i think so because i <UNKNOWN> <SIL> i <IVER>
when <SIL> in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people <SIL> on t v and then you start seeing a couple of black people on t v and then there was the jeffersons and although i found that jeffersons offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and <SIL> made fun of of of black people <SIL> in many ways in retrospect <SIL> it was trend setting <SIL> and what it did in in even in putting blacks <SIL> in <SIL> um <SIL> advertisements on t v <SIL> young kids saw them <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-a=and> and saw those ads and saw those t v programs <SIL> and so it became <SIL> uh <SIL> a part of everyday life <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=and> and <VOCNOISE> the more you see something the more it <CUTOFF-be=becomes> <VOCNOISE> becomes more acceptable <SIL> so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now we'll look back on those t v programs and <VOCNOISE> think they were trend setting instead of stereotypical <SIL> um <SIL> but it i'm sure it does have uh <SIL> some influence because <SIL> i think it did <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> it wasn't <SIL> the <SIL> only thing that had an influence <SIL> but it was one of the little <UNKNOWN> <SIL> pieces <SIL> of the puzzle that that helps <SIL> i think matthew shepherd helped <SIL> also <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> not in my lifetime <SIL> he'd hafta <CUTOFF-b=be> <SIL> probably be a closet gay
