<VOCNOISE> i don't think they get the attention they need <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
but <SIL> i don't think it's bad <IVER>
i don't think it's bad because he did go to a day care when he was little <VOCNOISE> before his grandmother started watching him <VOCNOISE> and um um <VOCNOISE> i mean it <EXT-was> yknow <CUTOFF-you=your> you're got people you don't know watching your kid and that's kinda scary but <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> you <VOCNOISE> gotta check things out first before you put your kid anywhere <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> yeah for them to go to a <CUTOFF-dayc=daycare> yeah make <SIL> i would think <VOCNOISE> he'll for them to interact with the kids more yeah <VOCNOISE> but <CUTOFF-whe=where> <VOCNOISE> where he goes there's he's got <ERROR-ill=all> <ERROR-z=his> cousins and stuff there with him so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah he's not getting that i don't think he's getting that learning <VOCNOISE> he's he's more his <VOCNOISE> uh that's his grandmother yknow watching him <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i <HES-wish> <CUTOFF-s=she> that she would like <SIL> do more of the learning things that the day cares do do yknow <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i guess <IVER>
yeah <CUTOFF-I=I> <VOCNOISE> i yknow get on her to make sure she sits down and reads with him <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> because i do put when i get home with him i <VOCNOISE> yknow sit down do his a b c's one two threes but <VOCNOISE> he loves to read books so i try to get her to do that <ERROR-inthed=instead> of just let them play all day and <IVER>
just yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
nope <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she that's a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> no <LAUGH> <IVER>
well <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> as <SIL> i mean like i was saying i <VOCNOISE> he's at the ages where he needs to <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> start learning things and she just does not do that i and that's probably the way she raised her kids <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> no we have totally different opinions about everything <IVER>
period <VOCNOISE> because they're from <VOCNOISE> um a different <SIL> they're from the virgin islands <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> so they're like <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-d=differet> not american ways yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> yeah i <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> discipline she's not <VOCNOISE> she's not as <ERROR-shirk=strict> as i am i don't <IVER>
i don't allow no hitting no yknow <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> she kind of <CUTOFF-neg=neglects> <SIL> lets it get away she lets him be a little rough because he's a boy but <VOCNOISE> i don't <VOCNOISE> hm <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> they're all <VOCNOISE> boys <IVER>
they're all boys there <VOCNOISE> so <LAUGH> when i pick him up from there <EXT-he's> <VOCNOISE> out of hand <VOCNOISE> a little bit and i've gotta <VOCNOISE> get him back yknow you're with mommy now you've got to behave <VOCNOISE> settle down <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i work <VOCNOISE> i work part time <VOCNOISE> kind of <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i worked full time <VOCNOISE> when he <CUTOFF-w=was> <VOCNOISE> was uh <VOCNOISE> yknow one and i didn't uh i felt like <SIL> um the babysitters or <VOCNOISE> yknow whoever saw him more than i did <VOCNOISE> and that <CUTOFF-re=really> because i love my son more then anything in the world and i <VOCNOISE> felt like he needed me <VOCNOISE> yknow so i went down to part time <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-t=to> <SIL> i'm struggling more but <VOCNOISE> i'd rather see my son have me <SIL> yknow <IVER>
