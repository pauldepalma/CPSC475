<SIL> anything that was foreign in my bed and not knowing it it would wake me up <SIL> especially i mean i think you <VOCNOISE> kind of have <HES-word> <SIL> different <VOCNOISE> level of awareness <VOCNOISE> when you are a mother and you're sleeping in a bed with your <VOCNOISE> infant <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
pretty well <SIL> there <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i think that's a little harder because he was an only child for <VOCNOISE> nearly five years <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> it's been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother <SIL> it's it's really he he nurtures him too so <SIL> it's neat to watch <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> right and they're in so much competition <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
well actually i've <SIL> picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> i'm working for a research firm <VOCNOISE> just for the convenience of the hours i i want to get back into the nursing field but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> right now i just can't <SIL> take that much time <SIL> away <SIL> because that would be least an eight hour shift and <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> don't <SIL> think <SIL> that we're ready for that <LAUGHyet> <VOCNOISE> he's a teacher <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> he works at a high school yeah <SIL> he teaches ninth and tenth graders <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> no <SIL> <LAUGH-I> don't think that at all <LAUGH> i'd be deceiving myself i think <VOCNOISE> i i guess when i <SIL> i heard about him i'm just like oh my gosh i can't believe <VOCNOISE> all of the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the things that these kids are experiencing i didn't <VOCNOISE> know about <SIL> whatever until i was much much older i didn't worry about that when i was that age and <VOCNOISE> it's kind of scary <IVER>
i have no <LAUGH-idea> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> i guess my <SIL> i guess what i would say <SIL> mostly for that is that <VOCNOISE> the parents are too busy with their own careers <VOCNOISE> and they don't take time <SIL> to raise their kids <VOCNOISE> and establish the morals <VOCNOISE> in the home <VOCNOISE> and they're just like oh well they'll learn it <SIL> there <VOCNOISE> whatever <VOCNOISE> and the kids <SIL> um <SIL> they're <SIL> basic <SIL> where they learn things is their peers they don't get it <SIL> everything instilled at home <VOCNOISE> that's pretty much <SIL> what <SIL> yknow i've <VOCNOISE> seen talking to my husband and <VOCNOISE> yknow and there's so many broken homes and single moms and trying to <VOCNOISE> trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to <VOCNOISE> grow up before they're ready <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> but yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> the media exposure <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i blame it on that yeah because yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's been a lot more kids that have died in school <VOCNOISE> then yknow <SIL> just recently i guess it wasn't in the biggin numbers at one time <VOCNOISE> but there's been random <SIL> violence in schools yknow <SIL> where kids would die even more than <VOCNOISE> yknow seven or whatever <SIL> and i think that the media's just made it into something <VOCNOISE> that they've glamorized it and some of the kids i think are screwed up anyway and they're just like well hey yknow <SIL> i can do that and i'll be on the <CUTOFF-te=tv> yeah <SIL> i do i think that's a big part of that <SIL> because they want <SIL> their name known and they don't care if they die anyway <VOCNOISE> um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> it's been glamorized and they don't <SIL> they don't value <SIL> human life either <SIL> i don't think because there's so much violence <SIL> yknow you can't <SIL> watch tv and not seeing <VOCNOISE> somebody get shot or something <SIL> and it's just like it's not really real <VOCNOISE> because it's yknow you turn the channel and you see the same actor doing something else and you're like see it wasn't real and <VOCNOISE> i don't think they <SIL> i think <SIL> i don't know <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah because they think they're grown <SIL> they think they're grown and they're like <SIL> twelve and thirteen and they've been having sex since they were ten and <VOCNOISE> it's just <VOCNOISE-like-gosh> <LAUGH-gosh> <VOCNOISE> and you know how and they're having babies earlier and earlier and <SIL> it's just really <SIL> scary <IVER>
i think it should be the parent's responsibility <SIL> but i have no objection to them teaching it <SIL> somewhat in the schools i guess <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> i don't know that they <HES-would> use the <LAUGH-information> if they had it <LAUGH> <LAUGH> i i don't know <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
i personally agree with that but that's just from my own moral beliefs and <VOCNOISE> everything but i don't know <SIL> i i don't think that there's one solution that'll fit every <SIL> every <SIL> child and every situation <VOCNOISE> i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so <VOCNOISE> yknow obviously his he said his dad told him about condoms yknow so <SIL> they're gonna make that decision on their own i say just <SIL> and and plus with the internet and everything they <SIL> they have access to so much information <SIL> and i think that it falls back on the parents still <SIL> if you're gonna be a parent you need to be <LAUGH-responsible> <VOCNOISE> and i don't think that <SIL> it's getting done <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum
