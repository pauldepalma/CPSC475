<IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> right and you know what's gonna happen <SIL> it's only when it gets so bad <SIL> that they can't even walk to their car they can't even go to <SIL> to the store <VOCNOISE> without being affected by that they can't say that anymore <SIL> yknow it's the people that <VOCNOISE> if i don't see it it's not there <SIL> they're the ones that are gonna be the most shocked <SIL> and they're the ones that are gonna be <VOCNOISE> panicked <SIL> when everything yknow because it's getting smaller the world's getting smaller we're <SIL> we're more populated now than we ever have been <SIL> so people need to learn to work together and to be together <SIL> and <IVER>
gosh <VOCNOISE> yknow that's one of the things that i've really yknow when i read the paper i think wow what can you do <VOCNOISE> it has to start there first <SIL> yknow and i think if <SIL> um <SIL> and i <LAUGH> <SIL> and this might be because i'm a woman but <VOCNOISE> i think if women <VOCNOISE> started running things <VOCNOISE> it would be a lot different than when men <SIL> run things because <VOCNOISE> men tend to <SIL> think yknow like the government and that kind of thing <VOCNOISE> those <VOCNOISE> kind of um <VOCNOISE> funds <VOCNOISE> that are available for different organizations and <VOCNOISE> they're all geared toward things that <VOCNOISE> essentially help them <SIL> as a whole <SIL> or help um <SIL> well <VOCNOISE> yeah but i mean not so much that um <VOCNOISE> it's always been the women's responsibility to be responsible for the kids <VOCNOISE> or to care about their well being and the a <SIL> peaceful environment and all that kind of thing <VOCNOISE> men are more <VOCNOISE> let's go get it and yknow we need more money and <SIL> yknow they're <IVER>
yeah more <UNKNOWN> yeah or more <VOCNOISE> yknow i don't i don't even know <SIL> because to start it's just such a huge problem and it's gotten so out of hand <VOCNOISE> it's gonna be everybody all together that has to work it's gonna be the teachers and the <VOCNOISE> government and <VOCNOISE> everybody but they all have to have one common thing <SIL> and it cracks me up because <VOCNOISE> we're so concerned about elian <SIL> this this poor little kid <VOCNOISE> everybody knows who he is <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow you look at our own kids we don't even care about our own kids as much as we care <VOCNOISE> i mean here's this little kid <VOCNOISE> who still has a living parent <SIL> and and i don't understand that at all i mean that is just so <VOCNOISE> i think the government gets involved in <SIL> totally yknow <SIL> way out of line <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
yeah yeah <VOCNOISE> i don't i don't know but it then then they second guess <VOCNOISE> the mother and she risked her life and all and they <NOISE> they can't do that <VOCNOISE> i mean yknow it's too bad that <SIL> yknow she wasn't there to <VOCNOISE> to go on with what they were planning on doing but <VOCNOISE> it's not our right to to take other countries kids even <VOCNOISE> i mean that's another thing <VOCNOISE> i mean come to america we'll take everyone and every yknow <VOCNOISE> but then we have all these this crime <SIL> because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that's all they've grown up with <SIL> is the terrorist activities and <VOCNOISE> the mentality and all that they come here and if they can't make it <SIL> then they'll just bomb somewhere and <SIL> then <LAUGH> but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that yknow you uh you kind of <VOCNOISE> wanna do a study of how long they've been here and <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> that'd be interesting <VOCNOISE> um i think there's gotta be a line drawn <SIL> and i think that um <SIL> yknow if they're <SIL> if they're caught um and and it's any kind of crime or anything and i know they send them back <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <SIL> i just think that we're just too open with that and there's gotta be a line to say <VOCNOISE> this is as many people as as we care to yknow <SIL> i mean and i know that's hard but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and it's hard to draw the line but then other countries <SIL> if it's so miserable there <SIL> then they need to work on their <SIL> country <SIL> because <IVER>
whoa i yeah really <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um <IVER>
yeah one is still in high school and she <SIL> she's ready to she wants to go on to college <SIL> so she's pretty much <SIL> ready <SIL> to go i mean she do she's got one more year <SIL> of high school but <SIL> uh and i held her back in kindergarten <VOCNOISE> so she's <VOCNOISE> older graduate she'll be nineteen when she graduates <SIL> and then <EXCLUDE-name> on the other hand graduated when she was seventeen <SIL> so <SIL> um <SIL> then my youngest daughter amy she is uh <VOCNOISE> she's doing real well i mean she's getting really good grades a's and b's <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> with <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> she had kind of a hard time <SIL> in high school <SIL> she was <SIL> uh raped <SIL> by a teacher in ninth grade <SIL> when she first went into a school <SIL> and from there it's just been a nightmare of what <SIL> how that it's affected her <SIL> yknow anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back and you say oh i wonder <SIL> you know if she was like that because of this and <SIL> yknow so that's been a real struggle and high school <SIL> i was <SIL> i never really <SIL> was that um excited about it for her because the memories she has <SIL> she went on to a different school and she met a lot of good people there <VOCNOISE> and she <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah ever authority figures at all <SIL> yknow she's she's really strong about that though because <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> she doesn't look at anybody being <SIL> be uh <VOCNOISE> yknow maybe <SIL> more wiser more experienced in things but <SIL> yknow certainly she doesn't trust anybody <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <SIL> yeah and that's the thing about schools too <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> totally disagree with uniforms <SIL> yknow unless it's <SIL> all slacks <SIL> all of it <VOCNOISE> because you get the <VOCNOISE> the girls in the uniforms and they're short <SIL> and they can't enforce that they don't enforce that <SIL> and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row <SIL> i should have went and met him <SIL> or i should have said hey yknow hey this uh yknow <VOCNOISE> haven't met me and i and i really <VOCNOISE> yknow fault myself for that <SIL> but it's made me more aware too and i <SIL> yknow when you look at someone and you say oh you would never dream that they <VOCNOISE> well i do <SIL> yknow there isn't anything i don't <SIL> put past anybody doing <VOCNOISE> i really don't cause they just <SIL> yeah <SIL> oh <LAUGH> <LAUGH=no> no no i do because there's some good ones out there there's some bad ones too but yknow <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> um it's awareness again <SIL> i mean <SIL> yknow put two and two together you get some young <VOCNOISE> teachers <SIL> right out of of college <SIL> and then you put em with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean <VOCNOISE> you can't even <SIL> you can't control the attraction there <SIL> but you can be aware of it <SIL> and you can <SIL> you can um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> put the put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> they've got stairs up and down and <VOCNOISE> yknow they get in their lockers and they bend over yknow and that's <SIL> that's just too much <VOCNOISE> i mean i think that's the first thing that has to be done take away <VOCNOISE> that yknow they shouldn't even be <VOCNOISE> uh that shouldn't even be a thought <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> and it's distracting enough for the the guys their own age <VOCNOISE> but then you put these young teachers in there maybe they're single guys that were just had a hell of a time in hall in college <VOCNOISE> and then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh <VOCNOISE> well yknow you gotta look at that you gotta be more aware <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i think <SIL> i think that there should be <SIL> a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory um sexual harassment tapes <SIL> and <SIL> and you learn you teach the girls <SIL> that it's not what they do it's how they make you feel <SIL> is is <SIL> constituted as your uh <SIL> yeah harassment there <SIL> and they're too afraid <SIL> and then besides that they yknow there's crushes on yknow you can't fault the girls for having crushes and <VOCNOISE> things like that they're going through enough things as it is <IVER>
but you can make them aware if somebody <SIL> as an adult steps over that <SIL> line <SIL> or makes them uncomfortable <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> there should be some kind of a s <SIL> a system <SIL> to where these girls the slightest bit <SIL> yknow it's anonymous it's <SIL> yknow <IVER>
probably but they don't they won't <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> part of is they feel flattered part of it is like wow the yknow this guy thinks i'm nice looking or whatever
