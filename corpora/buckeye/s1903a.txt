<SIL> gave me these leading questions and i said uh huh <VOCNOISE> i know where you're coming from i been confronted with that <VOCNOISE> when i was at ohio state and so forth <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> so i just layed it on the line to her <IVER>
in my own <VOCNOISE> civilian terms i said <VOCNOISE> why would you wanna give up on the original <SIL> yknow why would you wanna give up on the original have a copy <VOCNOISE> because all these others <VOCNOISE> wannabes <VOCNOISE> well in other words you follow christianity <IVER>
the catholic church is the first <SIL> christian church <VOCNOISE> and all the others <VOCNOISE> are fragments <VOCNOISE> they wannabe they still tie back to it but uh don't want <EXT-that> <VOCNOISE> it's like the commitment i was telling you <VOCNOISE> well i'd like to but <VOCNOISE> could you make a little extra <VOCNOISE> give me two more minutes to make that field goal <VOCNOISE> oh yeah we'll give you those but <VOCNOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> then we'll start we'll start only up here <VOCNOISE> and we <VOCNOISE> and we'll organize all this stuff but then we're gonna give two extra minutes in our rules <NOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> we gonna live this way and uh so forth <VOCNOISE> so we we <VOCNOISE> we develop things as they accommodate to our own selfish <EXT-beings> <VOCNOISE> not to the <VOCNOISE> sacrifice of what we should be doing <VOCNOISE> and we're all mortal and we're all gonna be <VOCNOISE> in that <VOCNOISE> and we're i'm not saying no one makes those errors makes errors it's always there <VOCNOISE> the problem is <VOCNOISE> to <VOCNOISE> try to stay focused <VOCNOISE> on that <VOCNOISE> not to jump ship <VOCNOISE> yknow they say in this country <VOCNOISE> oh you don't like leave it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
why would you wanna leave you said you're a third world country <VOCNOISE> why would you wanna be to table to i'd been <VOCNOISE> i wouldn't <UNKNOWN> this this country has a lot of problems <VOCNOISE> it's just like <SIL> my family has a lot of problems why would i <CUTOFF-w-aa=wanna> <CUTOFF-l-iy=leave> <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-p-r-aa-b=problems> <VOCNOISE> leave the family why would i leave the country <VOCNOISE> why not <VOCNOISE> work with it and correct it cause when i run away from it <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> yknow what i'm doing <VOCNOISE> i'm running into another chaos <VOCNOISE> at the other end <VOCNOISE> someone else coming the other direction <VOCNOISE> and they haven't resolved things <VOCNOISE> and that's been happening our society <VOCNOISE> we haven't <VOCNOISE> sit down <VOCNOISE> to learn <VOCNOISE> and understand one another f <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> as i told my <SIL> daughter when she came i said yknow <SIL> religion is is <VOCNOISE> is a business she says oh no dad it's not religion <VOCNOISE> i said it sure is a business <VOCNOISE> i said <VOCNOISE> it's just <VOCNOISE> the superficial things <VOCNOISE> the packages <VOCNOISE> are attractive to you <IVER>
and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite <SIL> article <SIL> every now and then <SIL> um-hum <VOCNOISE> i said but when you get down to the meat <SIL> of it <VOCNOISE> it's the same thing <VOCNOISE> and i said <VOCNOISE> and that's where it comes down to <VOCNOISE> the catholic church for example <VOCNOISE> they can put all you can have folk masses you can do all this superficial stuff on the thing to make it more attractive <VOCNOISE> and they do every <VOCNOISE> every religion <VOCNOISE> makes it more attractive for her <VOCNOISE> oh as used to <UNKNOWN> come from oh yeah <VOCNOISE> but the bottom line is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're trying to still <VOCNOISE> if you're a christian <VOCNOISE> focus back to the bible <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> how do you do how do you get back to the original without <SIL> being part of the original <IVER>
well my question is <VOCNOISE> who's more important in our basketball team <VOCNOISE> the five starters or the sixth man coming off the bench <VOCNOISE> i ask you now who <VOCNOISE> ask george reese is he more <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> is he less important this year than he was last year <IVER>
well that i'm making an analogy with you women <VOCNOISE> who's more important <VOCNOISE> who saying <VOCNOISE> that not <VOCNOISE> being <VOCNOISE> not being a priest <VOCNOISE> is not important <VOCNOISE> being your individual <VOCNOISE> we're <VOCNOISE> all called to <VOCNOISE> be <VOCNOISE> important <VOCNOISE> a priest is just as <VOCNOISE> a occupation <VOCNOISE> a part of that society out there <VOCNOISE> he do <VOCNOISE> president of the united states isn't any better off than you are <VOCNOISE> he shouldn't be <IVER>
what <VOCNOISE> we're animals <IVER>
we're animals <VOCNOISE> everyone's looking for leaders <VOCNOISE> it's the rules of church simplest rule <IVER>
so if you want get to me two more minutes a play <VOCNOISE> okay now you got another leg <VOCNOISE> but the thing is <VOCNOISE> let me ask you question <VOCNOISE> how does that impact you if you can't be a priest <NOISE> aren't there <VOCNOISE> other <VOCNOISE> important <VOCNOISE> quote unquote <VOCNOISE> roles for women <VOCNOISE> in the church <VOCNOISE> aren't there other important roles <IVER>
aren't there other important roles <VOCNOISE> what would those nuns be <VOCNOISE> where would your mother <VOCNOISE> possibly been if she went to catholic school <VOCNOISE> i take it <VOCNOISE> where would she have been <SIL> if it weren't for the nuns <VOCNOISE> why we put nuns down <VOCNOISE> hey <VOCNOISE> they worked <VOCNOISE> lot less than your mother <VOCNOISE> is even getting compensated for <VOCNOISE> and they had a very important role <VOCNOISE> for <VOCNOISE> your <VOCNOISE> development <VOCNOISE> even though you're generation is removed <IVER>
well that gets back to what you're saying almost th the family life <VOCNOISE> hey what's ahead <VOCNOISE> what you don't need a <NOISE> husband all you need is a sperm bank <VOCNOISE> that's what you're saying aren't you <VOCNOISE> aren't you <IVER>
yes you are you're saying you don't need to have a leader <VOCNOISE> in the family <VOCNOISE> you <VOCNOISE> and if i'm gonna be a leader i'm gonna be the one <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna be the one not the sperm bank oh you came from this little tube here oh okay that's the principle family no i hafta be because <VOCNOISE> there's no father here <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<IVER>
again they set different roles <IVER>
the <IVER>
they set different roles up fine <VOCNOISE> give me two more minutes to play <IVER>
the problem is <VOCNOISE> lack of commitment <VOCNOISE> the lack of commitment <VOCNOISE> and not saying hey <VOCNOISE> there's a niche for you <VOCNOISE> you can't be a male <SIL> oh yeah you wanna do the operation i can't be feeling yeah you wanna do <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> why not be happy what you are god made you what you are <VOCNOISE> why not make <VOCNOISE> you the complete person you are <VOCNOISE> and not strive for something you can't <VOCNOISE> be <IVER>
that's the thing <VOCNOISE> but the thing is some people <VOCNOISE> some people say <VOCNOISE> some people say <VOCNOISE> well watch this the thing is <VOCNOISE> why don't you talk to those people and say hey <VOCNOISE> why not <VOCNOISE> do what i'm doing best <VOCNOISE> in other words compliment the team <IVER>
yes <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
so we lower the standards to meet that <IVER>
product certain things <SIL> but they <VOCNOISE> they want everything to be the same they can't be <SIL> they can't be the same it's just a natural thing <VOCNOISE> but the thing is <VOCNOISE> let them <SIL> do what they can <VOCNOISE> that's a god given talent what you have there <VOCNOISE> okay nurse <VOCNOISE> and how many refuse the nurse voluntarily <VOCNOISE> when they have children <VOCNOISE> why <VOCNOISE> talking among you women folk <VOCNOISE> why <VOCNOISE> do you have well i don't want to <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> you have the natural ability <VOCNOISE> to give all the <VOCNOISE> all the natural protein the immunization things all that maternal milk why can't you instead of getting off the shelf <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
it's just a rule <IVER>
it's a rule coming down hand down <IVER>
tradition <IVER>
there's a tradition <VOCNOISE> you see now you're looking you're looking for reasons <VOCNOISE> that's <VOCNOISE> looking for science <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> go back and ask them <UNKNOWN> as as as i would ask uh uh my uh <VOCNOISE> english teacher in school uh <VOCNOISE> anybody that said well what this poet <VOCNOISE> uh what was his <VOCNOISE> now he wrote this <EXT-poem> <VOCNOISE> um <CUTOFF-g-ah=?> i gave my interpretation no no now they say <VOCNOISE> no no that wasn't it <VOCNOISE> they share their thought <VOCNOISE> how do you know that was it <VOCNOISE> he's been <VOCNOISE> dead <IVER>
so how do you know <VOCNOISE> how do you know <IVER>
as a teacher how would you <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> how could you cut down a student and say no that's not the way it was <SIL> and it's nothing <SIL> you're learning from a teacher's guide <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> no but how do you know if i ask in the first <VOCNOISE> but it's a matter of tradition of handing it down to the tradition <VOCNOISE> itself <VOCNOISE> it's a matter of having in your family <VOCNOISE> what did your parents think of this way and that way <VOCNOISE> and it's <VOCNOISE> it's not <UNKNOWN> necessarily <SIL> written down but it's passed on those days probably written down or not written down but <VOCNOISE> verbal <VOCNOISE> and extended <VOCNOISE> and so it's that <SIL> hand down from generation
