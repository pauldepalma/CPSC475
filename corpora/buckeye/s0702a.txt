so <IVER>
i don't know but if everybody's ever gone i'm gonna i'll <SIL> i'll <SIL> find some i'm sure <IVER>
i'm i'm gonna keep doing the same stuff yknow i'll find some other kid somewhere else and i'll have some time yknow my husband and i'll have time together and <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i always find some i always have a project <SIL> yknow it's like <VOCNOISE> i'm always saying <VOCNOISE> well when things slow down around here i'm gonna like right now i should be home counting money for the <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-r=raise> i did a fundraiser for the the school <HES-and> we <SIL> raised um <VOCNOISE> we just sell <SIL> uh morley candy and wrapping paper and all that kind of stuff <VOCNOISE> and our sales are anywhere from twenty five thousand to forty thousand dollars and so we get half of that for the profit and i do that sale myself but that also means <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> i have thousands and thousands of dollars to sort through and reconcile <VOCNOISE> so but anyhow i'm always saying when it slows down but then i always will find another project <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> and i <SIL> rehab houses <SIL> whenever i get a chance i like to do that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <IVER>
<CUTOFF-the=there'll> <CUTOFF-there'll> <IVER>

because i've always liked to fix up <CUTOFF-hou=houses> <SIL> my own house <IVER>
yeah <UNKNOWN-you_can_just> yeah it's fun <IVER>
uh huh <SIL> uh huh <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
too much <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
that's what you want <IVER>
yep <IVER>
yep <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
isn't that fun <IVER>
oh i know it's so much fun <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i just like doing it and <VOCNOISE> i have a good set i my <HES-my> best friend is a realtor uh she's since retired but <VOCNOISE> it's so funny because she would always go through <HES-all> these <SIL> statistics and this and that because it the stuff i've done is in <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and because i live in <EXCLUDE-name> area <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> she would say oh i don't know and she'd say well how much do you have to get it for and how much should <VOCNOISE> and i would say <VOCNOISE> oh i don't know i think if i get it for under a hundred and five i probably can sell it for a hundred and forty if i do this this this and this <SIL> now you're gonna put a lot of money into that though it's not like you're you're still only gonna make maybe ten thousand dollars profit <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> and she would say <VOCNOISE> well i don't know and for a long time she was always real skeptical because i would just like make up these numbers or just have this idea <VOCNOISE> and finally she says oh well rachel <VOCNOISE> i don't know it always works out for you you always get that so just <SIL> do it and it's just some <SIL> intuition kind of thing <IVER>
but it's fun <IVER>
uh huh me too years ago <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i know that's <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i <LAUGH-know> <IVER>
it's so funny that's what my daughters i do we're <CUTOFF-goi=going??> then we're always looking and saying <VOCNOISE> hmm there could do this this this this <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> and plus <IVER>
it is and plus the thing is too like when we bought our house we had looked for <SIL> months and months and months and i wanted an old house <VOCNOISE> it was built like nineteen seventeen <VOCNOISE> i wanted an old house that hadn't been <VOCNOISE> kept up <IVER>
yeah the same thing you were talking about and uh we're only the third people to live in it <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> it needed <SIL> everything yknow and it had gold <CUTOFF-carp+carpet> now gold's back but in those days everything was like gold and yknow and <VOCNOISE> green it was horrible <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> it was great fun <SIL> we had <SIL> we had lot fun we <VOCNOISE> we took the back porch and made it part of the kitchen and had another back porch put on uh <VOCNOISE> finished the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put an in ground pool and <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i always joke because what i paid for it <VOCNOISE> i now owe three times that amount <SIL> on it <IVER>
but it's because <SIL> most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage <SIL> so it's just that kind of thing <IVER>
if you have specific questions we're never get to them <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
ok <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it <CUTOFF-to=took> it only took um the last one i did was on richards road which is right across from whetstone park <IVER>
and <SIL> it only took <SIL> um <SIL> less than two months <IVER>
yeah and i had sold within <CUTOFF-si=six??> <VOCNOISE> well i waited i knew that what had to have happen on the outside which is really only some paint uh <SIL> minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and <VOCNOISE> cleaning up the front yard and then we have <VOCNOISE> there's a guy who works for me who's um <VOCNOISE> i just don't know how he can <CUTOFF-a=afford?> how he makes a living because he's very very reasonable he's also very loyal to me he's done stuff for me for years <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> and he's not that old he's probably <SIL> he's <SIL> twenty eight or twenty nine now but anyhow pat went in <VOCNOISE> we added a bathroom there was a mud room we added a half bath off the kitchen and <SIL> we put in the uh changed the back door and put in the deck and <VOCNOISE> he did those kinds of things <SIL> and <SIL> yknow and then we were ready to go and i said i was gonna sell it myself and everybody said i was crazy <VOCNOISE> and i had an open house <SIL> and i sold it that day i had thirty i had <SIL> like thirty some people in i got my offer that afternoon i got what i wanted <VOCNOISE> well i didn't get immediately <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> the realtors told me i should ask a hundred thirty four and i asked a hundred forty six instead because i really <SIL> felt <SIL> i <CUTOFF-kn=knew?> <VOCNOISE> i knew that this was nice house and i knew it had beautiful hardwood floors built in bookcases <VOCNOISE> and i just knew that <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> that i could've seen me wanting that house and do you know what i mean it's like that identity thing <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> somebody came through and they <SIL> uh with a realtor and they made me this <SIL> offer that was real low it was like a hundred and thirty <SIL> eight <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> the the realtor it's i'm thinking about it because was funny he delivered the offer to my home and i was gracious and i thanked him and i got inside and i opened up and i <SIL> saw it <SIL> and i went running out a porch i say <VOCNOISE> wait a minute <VOCNOISE> this is <VOCNOISE> never gonna work <IVER>
i said this will never work <SIL> i'm not interested take it back <VOCNOISE> and he said <VOCNOISE> no no no just <VOCNOISE> let's just work with us just work with us we'll we'll take care of this <VOCNOISE> so i ended up selling to him for hundred and forty four <VOCNOISE> but it was just funny because i thought <VOCNOISE> he <SIL> i thought <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they're never gonna get to where i have to be and we're not even gonna play this game back and forth <IVER>
so and it was fun and i <SIL> i made uh we made about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> nine thousand on it by the time we were done <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um i <SIL> i um <SIL> i do all of our own taxes i really <SIL> i keep thinking i must be doing it wrong because it's not that hard everybody acts like oh this is such a big deal <IVER>

yeah and you read it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah exactly i know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> it i <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know how to tell you that um <VOCNOISE> i mean it it
