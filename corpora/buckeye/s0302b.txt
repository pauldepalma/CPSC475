<SIL> <VOCNOISE> lassie <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think i could summarize <CUTOFF-m=most?> <SIL> uh just with a few words of what you're meaning to say i <CUTOFF-m=may> <SIL> may be wrong <VOCNOISE> but i think you're really meaning to say we must get back <SIL> to the family <VOCNOISE> there must be two parents <VOCNOISE> and they must <CUTOFF-b=be?> <SIL> recognize their children and <VOCNOISE> do like <SIL> you have just discussed <VOCNOISE> uh do with them the <CUTOFF-sa=same?> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> because today we are just drifting and drifting and drifting we uh <VOCNOISE> fifty percent of uh everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as i <SIL> understand the statistics today <VOCNOISE> and uh unfortunately it's still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this is going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> once again we are talking about communications too uh and the communications can be ill and they can be great <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh as she's touched upon <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh oh but i feel that pendulum has to swing back from <VOCNOISE> the non family we're headed toward or have been headed toward <VOCNOISE> and get back to a <CUTOFF-f=family?> very basic family orientation <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it's> <CUTOFF-i=it's> <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> abhorrent when i <VOCNOISE> hear <HES-that> uh <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> oh was it seven ladies who were quote <SIL> beautiful ladies are now willing to sell <EXT-their> <EXT-uh> sperm uh well that's not their sperm well whatever that is they sell <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> for ten thousand dollars apiece and to be implanted in the other <VOCNOISE> so that they can produce <CUTOFF-k=quote?> uh a quote beautiful child <VOCNOISE> well a beautiful child uh <SIL> and if <ERROR-your've=you've talking about just the physical features <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=is> <CUTOFF-i=is> is meaningless <SIL> it's what <SIL> is embodied in that body that's <SIL> can be beautiful <VOCNOISE> instead of just the physical features that you look at <VOCNOISE> and that to me is abhorrent such a such an <EXT-idea> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-j=just> and that <SIL> indeed is gonna take away from family i <CUTOFF-ca=can't> <VOCNOISE> in my way of <VOCNOISE> thinking i can't imagine <VOCNOISE> that i would uh <SIL> have my wife producing <VOCNOISE> somebody else's child over <LAUGH-here> and i'm going to have <VOCNOISE> the same <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-f=fatherly> <SIL> thank you that's <CUTOFF-exa=exactly?> fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts toward or with that child <IVER>
yes to but that uh <UNKNOWN> more that has primarily because of necessity <VOCNOISE> uh more often than not uh <SIL> uh maybe even today it's less than that <VOCNOISE> because it's a <CUTOFF-bee=been?> <SIL> because of a loss of a parent <ERROR-ther=the+or?> or inability of a <ERROR-prernt=parent> <VOCNOISE> uh or parents <VOCNOISE> uh being able <EXT-to> handle those children <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> yes <HES-those> those things do exist and they will always have some <SIL> but that's a very small percentage though scott <SIL> <VOCNOISE>
