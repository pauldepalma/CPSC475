<VOCNOISE> like and the of is all those little words <SIL> you're already supposed to know those <VOCNOISE> you're supposed to <SIL> be able to write a sentence <SIL> even if it's just a little short sentence like my name is joanne <VOCNOISE> i live at blah blah blah street <VOCNOISE> i mean it's incredible <VOCNOISE> it's like <SIL> the curriculum keeps moving down <SIL> and down <SIL> and down <IVER>
well <SIL> they're supposed to do more too but by the time they get to fourth grade they're so busy trying to be the class clown <VOCNOISE> they decide it's a lot more important to impress your friends than it is to <VOCNOISE> fill your mind with knowledge <IVER>
yknow <SIL> they talk about drinking from the fountain now they're only gargling <SIL> they're not drinking <SIL> much <SIL> by the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade they're pretty savvy these days <SIL> they're not <SIL> too scared to tell you <SIL> where to go and what to do <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> oh yeah used to be <VOCNOISE> when i first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful <IVER>
and they would ask yknow can i do this can i use this <VOCNOISE> uh kids now if i take my phone off and lay it on my desk <VOCNOISE> kids will walk right up and just take it <SIL> they won't ask me they'll just <CUTOFF-l=?> <VOCNOISE> oh <VOCNOISE> and then they start pushing <CUTOFF-but=buttons> <VOCNOISE> is this your phone <VOCNOISE> i'm like <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> if i were at your house and i went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking you wouldn't like it much would you <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
just general manners <IVER>
i think it's because parents are at work and they're busy making money and they're not teaching their kids any <VOCNOISE> i mean they're not <CUTOFF-ta=taking?> teaching them to say thank you and please and just the normal <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> um thanks for having me when you go to someone's house <VOCNOISE> just the normal <SIL> i can't tell you how many kids i've picked up <VOCNOISE> and driven home <SIL> when i picked up my son because it was raining or something <VOCNOISE> and they just jump out of the car and go bye slam the door <VOCNOISE> and i turn to my son and i go <SIL> don't you ever do that to someone's mother <VOCNOISE> now how bad do you think i want to give <SIL> him another ride home <VOCNOISE> when he didn't even say thank you <SIL> yknow i didn't have to bother to go out of my way <VOCNOISE> and i'd always try to use that as a <SIL> way to explain to my kids <SIL> okay yknow <SIL> this is how he handled it <VOCNOISE> this is how i want you to handle it <VOCNOISE> i don't ever want you to go to someone's house and not say <VOCNOISE> thanks for inviting me thanks for having me <VOCNOISE> i really had a good time <VOCNOISE> yknow and i don't ever want you to sit at somebody else's table and go <VOCNOISE> yuk i don't like that <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> if they having something for supper you don't like <VOCNOISE> you pass it <VOCNOISE> on and you go i don't care for any thank you <VOCNOISE> you don't make a big scene like so and so did the other night at my house that <SIL> yknow made me feel like this big <SIL> when i'm the cook <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> so you can use all those <SIL> opportunities <SIL> to show your kid <SIL> what not to do <IVER>
and you can say well that's how that makes you feel when someone goes <VOCNOISE> eew we're having ham <VOCNOISE> i hate ham the other night i had ham and i threw up and blah blah <VOCNOISE> and my mom made me eat it and i threw up all over the floor and i'm like <VOCNOISE> don't you ever do that when you're at someone else's <CUTOFF-hou=house> <LAUGH> <IVER>
they know more knowledge <SIL> i wouldn't say they're more <VOCNOISE> <SIL> socially <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mature or uh more um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i mean there's even sweet little preschool girls that don't say please and thank you <SIL> yknow you have to remind them <IVER>
<SIL> well and i think it really <CUTOFF-sti=still> it still goes back to the mom and the dad <SIL> and <SIL> and what <SIL> the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow would i act this way would that make my mom and because until you're about five <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or four <SIL> your parents are pretty important to you <SIL> and what they think <VOCNOISE> so that's when <SIL> yknow <SIL> you have to instill that stuff <SIL> you have to <SIL> yknow <SIL> <CUTOFF-the=they> oh and they learn by watching you do it too <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh i mean my son now oh i saw him when let's see <SIL> he was fifteen maybe <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he'd run across the street <SIL> when martha the eighty six year old lady across <ERROR-steereet=the_street> <VOCNOISE> was trying to bring her garbage down <SIL> he'd seen me do that <SIL> go oh let me get that for you martha <VOCNOISE> she's got <SIL> arthritis she looks like she's gonna fall <SIL> she takes steps about this big <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i've seen him do that <IVER>
he learned that from watching me do it <SIL> he takes <CUTOFF-i=it?> yknow we come home he'll take the <CUTOFF-b=bag?> <SIL> the thing back up for her <UNKNOWN-say> oh martha will fall if she does this i better run over there and <VOCNOISE> take that up for her <VOCNOISE> well he's seen <SIL> his <CUTOFF-mo=mom> his mom and his dad do stuff like that <VOCNOISE> they really do learn best by example <SIL> they really do <SIL> yeah they do <SIL> they're much more likely to do what you do than do what you say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so you don't have to say anything as long as you live a good clean honest life <VOCNOISE> they're gonna emulate you <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
oh i think <SIL> i think that the society <SIL> in uh general is declining in a <LAUGH-lot_of> ways <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> our morals are <ERROR-degclining=degrading+declining?> and our <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> intelligence level <SIL> maybe not level i mean i q's are still high but people are <VOCNOISE> settling for less <SIL> i have a big sign in my room that says never settle <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for less than your very best <VOCNOISE> because i really think people <VOCNOISE> are getting lazy <SIL> even adults <CUTOFF-we=we> yknow we don't even want to wait twenty five seconds for microwave popcorn <VOCNOISE> we don't yknow we're getting impatient <IVER>
yeah we're getting impatient and we're getting <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> it's it's sort of like yknow the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from now there'll be <VOCNOISE> kids'll be yknow in this country will be learning more than they ever have <VOCNOISE> but right now i think we're <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we're really not <SIL> doing justice <SIL> to <SIL> the curriculum <SIL> and i say to <CUTOFF-m=my> my friends i say <VOCNOISE> teach these kids well because they're gonna be running the country in our old age <VOCNOISE> we'll be sit in a rocking chair and they'll be running the country so you better teach them well <SIL> when you look at it like that <IVER>
you it's quite an investment <IVER>
<IVER>
when you think that <SIL> our major resource <SIL> is <CUTOFF-ch=children> <SIL> is our children and our offspring <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then we'd better not <SIL> yknow <IVER>
well i think <IVER>
well i think in general like <SIL> let's say if you took <SIL> a <SIL> handful of executives from borden or <VOCNOISE> a t and t or <VOCNOISE> someplace like that <VOCNOISE> you would probably find that <SIL> in general they're very concerned <IVER>
if they're especially if they're over forty <VOCNOISE> because their company's giving money back to the community for this and that <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> yknow that's how they're trying to show that they care about this they're trying to <VOCNOISE> mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the <VOCNOISE> downtrodden or <SIL> yknow <SIL> but <SIL> you're right i think it's terrible that <SIL> every other country in the world <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> has higher math skills than we do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> better science skills than we do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> better language <ERROR-shkills=skills> than we do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> why canadians even go to school for thirteen years not twelve <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> i just think that <SIL> this proficiency thing is finally going to <VOCNOISE> make people accountable <SIL> <IVER>
the proficiency tests that they're now requiring <VOCNOISE> you can't graduate from an ohio high school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> with a <CUTOFF-gra=graduate> uh with a diploma <SIL> unless you pass <SIL> all the proficiency tests <VOCNOISE> and that means you have to take <VOCNOISE> one in citizenship <SIL> which is like government and history <VOCNOISE> one in math <VOCNOISE> one in science <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> one in writing <SIL> and one in reading <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you have <SIL> you can try to <SIL> pass <VOCNOISE> the first time in the <CUTOFF-e=eighth> at the end of the eighth grade <VOCNOISE> and you get two tries in the ninth grade <SIL> two tries in the tenth <SIL> two in the eleventh two in the twelfth <VOCNOISE> you can take them as many times as you need to take them <VOCNOISE> but if you don't pass them all by the time you graduate <VOCNOISE> you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate <SIL> it's not a real diploma it's like okay i attended <SIL> i didn't learn anything <VOCNOISE> but i was there <IVER>
how many people want that <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
and the questions aren't easy <SIL> <SIL> i mean <SIL> i mean the <SIL> i doubt if i could pass some of them <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i probably could pass the citizenship and the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the english <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and maybe the science because i like science and i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass the math <SIL> because i don't teach math and i don't use math that much <VOCNOISE> other than just normal <SIL> yknow add subtract multiply <IVER>
yeah and geometry and and trig and calculus and physics and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a little smattering of everything <SIL> and uh <SIL> i bet i couldn't pass the <VOCNOISE> i bet i couldn't pass the math without some <VOCNOISE> instruction <SIL> but <SIL> my son didn't pass the writing part he passed everything but the writing part <VOCNOISE> and the writing part <SIL> they ask you to write <SIL> two <SIL> five paragraph essays and they give you these topics and you can pick from them <VOCNOISE> and you have to do it right there <SIL> in like a three hour block of time <IVER>
no <SIL> the prompts are only given out that day <VOCNOISE> even the teachers don't know what they're gonna be <VOCNOISE> and it might be something as general as tell about your neighborhood <VOCNOISE> or it might be something as specific as <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when you were little what <SIL> toy was your most favorite <SIL> and you have to write five paragraphs on it <SIL> so <LAUGH> <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
no more than five because there's a specific <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> it's called the five paragraph essay <SIL> the first paragraph is your introduction and the final one is your conclusion and the three in the middle is the body that develops your idea <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> i'm teaching all my kids right <IVER>
one of those <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
on different topics <IVER>
oh it's some committee <SIL> i mean you have to send them in to <VOCNOISE> some place at the state of ohio <IVER>
no <IVER>
we send them in <SIL> and then <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the kids <SIL> lets see the eighth graders take them in march and then we get the <CUTOFF-pa=papers> <VOCNOISE> the scores back in may <SIL> sometime <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> some of my kids <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well i have a group of kids that i had them when they were sixth graders and they just now graduated <SIL>
