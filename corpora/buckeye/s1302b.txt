because i've <EXT-seen> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> things that are not <SIL> physically possible <IVER>
they're supposed to be not physically possible <SIL> <SIL> goes against the first law of physics <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i saw it happen <SIL> <IVER>
i experienced it <SIL> well <SIL> ah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and some of our ceremonies <EXT-yknow> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> this is confidential right <SIL> no one else is gonna see this <VOCNOISE> because i don't wanna <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i don't wanna have any of this printed or anything <VOCNOISE> yknow it uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
all right <IVER>
well in in the ambiguous part of it yknow just saying try to be <SIL> protective of <SIL> the ways <IVER>
of the people of this land that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's in a <CUTOFF-c=ceremony> a ceremony called an eneepee which is a sweat lodge <SIL> and a lot of people will talk about sweat lodge um <SIL> it involves heating up stones <SIL> in a fire <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <EXT-uh> <VOCNOISE> putting the stones <EXT-in> <EXT-the> <SIL> lodge <SIL> and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not a sauna <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's <SIL> not a uh steam room <IVER>
uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a very spiritual <SIL> experience <SIL> yes it gets hot in there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> how hot <SIL> who knows <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> it's been such a strengthening <SIL> spiritually strengthening <SIL> thing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it also <SIL> physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out of your body because of that heat <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> it gets all the crap out of you <IVER>
yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it clears you purifies you that's what it was for <SIL> that's what the people used it for purification <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and even <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's made up of four rounds usually sometimes three <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-uh> and the last round is usually called the purification round <SIL> where whoever's pouring the sweat the spiritual leader that's pouring the sweat <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he'll make it tough on you <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he'll pour all the water that's left in that bucket <SIL> and he'll do it in a way <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it just brings that heat out that steam that breath that sacred breath is what we call it <IVER>
god <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and breathing that <SIL> it's like when we were in the womb of her mother <SIL> we were breathing water <SIL> we were breathing <SIL> fluid <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> oxygen is in that fluid too <SIL> it's in that mist that goes over the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the fields <IVER>
god's in that <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> even when a cow takes a crap in the middle of the field and that steam comes off it in the winter time <SIL> <VOCNOISE> god's in that steam <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a lot of people can't understand that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-but> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <CUTOFF-the> the the laws of thermodynamics say that it's impossible for rocks to retain heat that way and that they can't be heated to an adequate point of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> of withholding heat <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> or sustaining heat <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when heated by a fire <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that <SIL> you would need <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> like in the old days yknow to melt metal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they used uh air <SIL> pumping it through <IVER>
<EXT-coals> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like the blacksmiths or whatever yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<EXT-to> melt and <SIL> soften the metal so they could work with it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> yes the air would help increase the temperature <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> a fire kept for a long period of time <SIL> will be hotter than any kind of fire you've ever touched <SIL> or been around <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that fire is sacred it's a sacred fire <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so that's why it's possible <SIL> but <SIL> if it <SIL> if i went down there with the laws of physics <VOCNOISE> told me that those rocks <SIL> couldn't sustain heat <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yet i see when the fire keeper breaks them out of the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> out of the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that they're red orange glowing <SIL> you gonna tell me they're not hot <SIL> so that's that's one example <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
<SIL> yes <IVER>
i've done it <SIL> for the last uh <SIL> bout five years <IVER>
uh <SIL> how many i don't know it doesn't matter <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> been in <EXT-in> <VOCNOISE> many ones that were <SIL> too hard for me <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> and i had to get out <SIL> uh <SIL> and other ones <CUTOFF-i=it> it's a it's a struggle <SIL> with that thing and understanding it <SIL> takes time to understand it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lot of people lot of good people are helping me <SIL> to try and understand it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i was trying to let the fear of that <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> though i'm not afraid to die <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm afraid sometimes that i'll die before i get a chance to do <SIL> what i feel i was sent here to do <SIL> which is just the basic things <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fall in love with somebody have children raise them <IVER>
and move on <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> that's that's basically my fear <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh as one of the guys tried to help me he said well listen i'm afraid of that too and he said because right there in that pit there that's god <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now if you remember that <SIL> there's nothing in here that can hurt you <SIL> even as hot as it gets <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when you think about that <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you try not to think too much while you're in there <SIL> although it's hard to do especially if you're thinking about how hot it is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but if you're listening to people praying <SIL> and they're praying with their heart and i tell you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because of how hot it gets in there <SIL> you'll hear people pray straight from their heart <SIL> not a bunch of real fancy words <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in a real comfortable setting yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> that heat <IVER>
will that sacred heat will <IVER>
bring <SIL> what's in your heart out <SIL> and sometimes you'll say stuff that doesn't even make sense <SIL> but <SIL> you say it <SIL> and it brings it out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that's what it's for <SIL> so i mean it's uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's a struggle understanding that and uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i i made it through all four rounds this time <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh i even sat up which was the first time <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's a struggle <SIL> but it's a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's necessary for the way i follow <SIL> if i didn't especially for men women have a purification every month <IVER>
with their cycle <VOCNOISE> uh that's <SIL> the way the indian people believe that many of the woman refer to it as they're on their moon <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because when the moon's out the moon is that sacred <SIL> and there's that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that life <VOCNOISE> women have that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh gift of life that they can give <SIL> uh men can't do that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> there's just a lot there <SIL> that uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow women go through that purification every month so women really don't need the sweat lodge <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but it's there for them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they do participate <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
i've been some places where some men refuse to sweat with women <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> sometimes i <VOCNOISE> felt <SIL> kinda weird about it <IVER>
just because uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> women have a medicine <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and probably because that was lacking in my life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i couldn't focus on what i needed to focus on when i heard a woman's voice in there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but then some of the elders sat me down and and the other thing about the sweat lodge is men go in there in shorts <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> women go in there in a long cotton dress <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you'll hear people say you go in there naked <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh that's not true <SIL> i mean uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some of the older men in older tribes and different tribes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
they'll be naked but they'll still go in with a huge towel on <IVER>
yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so it's not a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there was a man named sun bear <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> who was uh <SIL> recruiting women <SIL> yknow <SIL> and telling them they had to sweat naked <IVER>
yknow <SIL> so he could get a look at them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which is very disrespectful but <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's some psychos out there man i mean there's some psycho around here in town called rainbow eagle <SIL> <VOCNOISE> gave himself that name <IVER>
didn't earn it the indian way <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> didn't have it done through ceremony nothing like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and even the man that he followed for a while sitting in a rest home over in south dakota now <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because he's old <SIL> he's on his way out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he was a road man gave his life yknow for eighty nine tribes <SIL> to help them find and refine their connection with their spirituality that they'd lost <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um because of the missionaries <SIL> bringing christianity <SIL> i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i've got nothing against christianity <SIL> but i got something against the way it was brought here <IVER>
and that's what i'm saying atoning for sins <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's quite a hypocrisy when you got a <SIL> <VOCNOISE> church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents <UNKNOWN> and went to all my life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> over the door of the church was a picture of christopher columbus with <SIL> <SIL> a missionary <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a priest <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and all his men with his sword drawn <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now <SIL> i asked the priest <SIL> cold hard question <SIL>
