yeah she's got <SIL> she's got <VOCNOISE> a lot of kids <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> there's um <SIL> three boys and <SIL> like four girls <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
maybe <IVER>

no it <ERROR-hapden=happened> quite a few times <VOCNOISE> and that <CUTOFF-w=was> i mean i also cheated on him too yknow we both did it <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> it <SIL> once i had my son <IVER>
i was ready to settle down i'm not <SIL> yknow i wasn't going for that stuff no more and he still wanted to do that <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> and lie and cheat make up stories and <VOCNOISE> and he still does it <SIL> i don't and and i don't understand why i feel like he's a grown man if he was out <VOCNOISE> don't make up a story <SIL> and <SIL> his mother also make <SIL> yknow they're just it just <VOCNOISE> it's very stressful for me and <VOCNOISE> and i that's another <VOCNOISE> another reason why i don't want my son going there for <CUTOFF-v=very> <SIL> yknow much longer <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> his dad pays <SIL> pays her <LAUGH> for the <LAUGH-babysitting> <VOCNOISE> because i can't afford it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and he's got control over that because i <SIL> i mean he was going to a different babysitter a woman <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> that baby sits <SIL> and she <CUTOFF-w=would?> did very very well she did all that stuff that i would like to <CUTOFF-d=?> be done she took him to the library <VOCNOISE> she had nap time at a certain time and they were and <SIL> yknow lay down and <SIL> it's just totally different <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=at> uh at the grandmother's <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
no <IVER>

yeah uh <VOCNOISE> i don't think he spends <EXT-time> with him like that yknow <VOCNOISE> he sees him at his mom's house <SIL> and <VOCNOISE-he> yknow will come by and see him at my house but <VOCNOISE> i try to <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> put a <VOCNOISE> i don't know because we seem to argue a lot <SIL> yknow <SIL> and i don't like to for my kid to see that <SIL> so i try <SIL> i try to do <SIL> the best thing for my son <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> like when i need things and i call him up i need diapers <VOCNOISE> i need wipes i need twenty dollars yeah <SIL> he's there for me <CUTOFF-the=there?> for that <VOCNOISE> financially yeah he's always been there <VOCNOISE> for me <IVER>
um <IVER>
hopefully <IVER>
it <IVER>
well it's kind of hard he see <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> he's got two other kids <VOCNOISE> and one kid he had while we was together <SIL> that he does not see at all <IVER>
because the mother <SIL> um he played her because he was with me and <VOCNOISE> yknow if <SIL> and she just was like forget him i don't want him to be around my child and the other one <VOCNOISE> she's a older she's <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she's like ten <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> he says that because his daughter don't call he only <CUTOFF-ca=calls> she only calls for <SIL> when she wants things <VOCNOISE> so he doesn't <VOCNOISE> yknow he'll <SIL> he'll get whatever he can for her when she calls but he doesn't spend time with her <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> so i just see a pattern <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> i just feel like this is gonna happen to me eventually <IVER>
well i <SIL> i <IVER>
i just hope he stays <CUTOFF-arou=around> i <VOCNOISE> i i don't know maybe not but <SIL> i grew up without a father and i really <SIL> um <SIL> have that <VOCNOISE> against my father because he lived around us he never called us yknow <VOCNOISE> it and now i've really got resentment against him <IVER>
<CUTOFF-m=?> i mean as old as i am i still got that against him <VOCNOISE> and that's what i'd i want my <SIL> yknow my son to keep <SIL> i want him to know his <CUTOFF-dn=dad?> <CUTOFF-d=dad> <SIL> father and be around him <SIL> even though he's not the best <SIL> best of person but <SIL> yknow <IVER>
i'll raise him the best way i can <IVER>
