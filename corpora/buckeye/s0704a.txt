<VOCNOISE> if that happened <SIL> i would be ten times more understanding and i would say <VOCNOISE> yknow i would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> i yeah i shouldn't have done that so now let's just go get some more furniture <LAUGH> <IVER>
do you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and and she always says oh mom it was fine she said <VOCNOISE> i got to do <VOCNOISE> a whole lot of things you won't let them do now <LAUGH> <LAUGH-in> <LAUGH-exchange> for that now that i know better <VOCNOISE> so <CUTOFF-ey=it's? she she's always very generous about it and says she had more time alone with me and <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> i got divorced when she was or her <VOCNOISE> i split up with her dad when she was about a year and a half <VOCNOISE> and so for until she was six it was just she and i <IVER>
so we had a lot of time together and she says she thinks that was worth it <IVER>
it was okay to put up with my trying to learn how to be a parent <VOCNOISE> in exchange for having me all to herself <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
in a <EXT-strange> <EXT-city> i <CUTOFF-kno=know> <VOCNOISE> oh my god <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well see <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <CUTOFF-fa=father?> my husband would do that though <VOCNOISE> it's so bizarre because <EXCLUDE-name> is <VOCNOISE> i don't know what's <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-d=don't?> <VOCNOISE> i honestly don't i think that's where his brain is completely lacking <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i make i get to make <SIL> all the decisions at my house about <VOCNOISE> discipline and about what people can do and can't do <VOCNOISE> and we <VOCNOISE> all understand this and it's perfectly fine <VOCNOISE> and he says <VOCNOISE> i'm not a good judge of that <VOCNOISE> you'll have to check <CUTOFF-wi=with> because my son when my son was like eleven <VOCNOISE> he let him come to campus with his skateboarding friends i said where are they <VOCNOISE> oh they said they were going down on <CUTOFF-ca=campus> <VOCNOISE> i said <VOCNOISE> on campus <VOCNOISE> over my dead body <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow> he's not allowed down there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and so <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=it's?> it's the thing is though <VOCNOISE> it's almost like <VOCNOISE> i'm really glad that <EXCLUDE-name> willing to say <VOCNOISE> i just can't make those <CUTOFF-de=decisions> uh he'd let <VOCNOISE> he'd let my daughter who's <CUTOFF-thirtee=thirteen> he left <VOCNOISE> left her at the movies one night <VOCNOISE> they went to the movies there was no um <VOCNOISE> the movie they went to see was sold out <VOCNOISE> the next one wasn't gonna start until nine thirty which means this kid's <NOISE-twelve> years old <VOCNOISE> so that would have been eleven thirty twelve <CUTOFF-owk=o'clock?> yknow <VOCNOISE> at the lennox he leaves her there with one of her friends <VOCNOISE> some boy <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> although <EXCLUDE-name> this tom-boy who's just amazing but so anyhow uh he left her there <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> uh <UNKNOWN> they said they called me but i <CUTOFF-diy=didn't?> i was running the sweeper so i didn't hear the phone <VOCNOISE> so <EXCLUDE-name> left her there and he said that she was gonna call back yknow at at a certain time and i was gonna tell her what she could or couldn't do <VOCNOISE> so i said yknow well you're gonna have to come <CUTOFF-he-here> home yknow he's gonna have to come and get you oh come <EXT-on> no <VOCNOISE> we're not gonna do that i you know you can't be this late <VOCNOISE> so he went back down <VOCNOISE> picked them <CUTOFF-u=up> <VOCNOISE> and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven <IVER>
then his parents can pick him up <VOCNOISE> and everybody was annoyed my husband said <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> i would've let her stay i don't understand why you're doing this <SIL> i don't care <VOCNOISE> i want her to come home <VOCNOISE> the other <VOCNOISE> well the bottom line it was hysterical because <VOCNOISE> she and this little boy they're outside and he they're jumping and he's jumping on the trampoline i go out to him and i introduce myself and i say yknow honey i said <VOCNOISE> really sorry about the plans but <VOCNOISE> i just you couldn't <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> i just could not let you <CUTOFF-guy=guys> her stay there that long he goes <VOCNOISE> oh that's okay my mom would never let me do that <VOCNOISE> so and i'm thinking yknow <VOCNOISE> here's <CUTOFF-a=all?> everybody's acting like i'm the bad guy <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i'm i'm the one who's into <VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> and so <VOCNOISE> there <CUTOFF-w=was?> i just wanna tell you one more thing that was funny because <SIL> um there was something <EXCLUDE-name> she wanted to skip a play rehearsal that i wouldn't let her skip <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> it was for a party that her friends were having <VOCNOISE> and i understood it was important to her but when you have commitments you <CUTOFF-j=just> you keep your commitments <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> was saying he agreed with me and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case <VOCNOISE> she goes <VOCNOISE> so what's with him <VOCNOISE> he never has an opinion <VOCNOISE> how come all of a sudden he's allowed to have an opinion tell me what i can do yknow it was really funny <VOCNOISE> we laughed about it and <VOCNOISE> i let her um <VOCNOISE> i let her skip <LAUGH-it> <LAUGH> because i decided that it was so important to her <IVER>
