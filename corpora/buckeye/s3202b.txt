<SIL> mm <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<EXT-I> think my mother was okay with it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <CUTOFF-a=all> all the conversations <UNKNOWN-I> had about <UNKNOWN> since then lead me to believe <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yes this didn't traumatize her <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i think it was kind of a no brainer for her as well <SIL> she's like ah yeah all your friends and your dad <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a large new experience that you don't know anything about <SIL> and me <VOCNOISE> talking to my mother was always a very arduous affair <IVER>
<CUTOFF-na=not> not <SIL> in sort of an evil sense <SIL> necessarily and but just in sort of a a challenging sense consistently <VOCNOISE> yes <CUTOFF-the=there> there was some sort of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> inherent communication breakdown my mother is kind of a flake <VOCNOISE> not that i'm not a flake but we're flaky in different ways <IVER>
yes <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE-correct> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <NOISE-that's> rude <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> trying come up with <SIL> like <EXT-uh> <SIL> <EXT-uh> a narrative that's <SIL> both fun and brief <SIL> <VOCNOISE> okay so <VOCNOISE> <EXT-um> <SIL> my friend chris and i are upstairs playing on the computer <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <EXT-um> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my sister's downstairs watching television <SIL> it's sunday morning <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> i am <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> trying to figure out how this game works <NOISE-trying> <NOISE-to> <NOISE-figure> how this game works and then i said <HES-I> got some information on this game out in the car i'm gonna go get it <SIL> chris you keep playing <VOCNOISE> i'll be right back <VOCNOISE> downstairs out the front door see my sister on <UNKNOWN-the> couch go over to the car <VOCNOISE> get the stuff out of the <NOISE-car> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> look up and there two police <NOISE-officers> coming towards me <SIL> <IVER>
like ooh <SIL> police officers <IVER>
ooh scary <VOCNOISE> okay <VOCNOISE> and <CUTOFF-i=it> <VOCNOISE> it was funny because <VOCNOISE> you see the cops first <VOCNOISE> but in reality the cops are behind <NOISE-two> other people i actually know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but it doesn't matter <NOISE> because you always see cops first <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> the two other people that i actually know are <EXT-my> <EXT-stepmother> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-stepmother's> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-um> parents <SIL> <VOCNOISE> stepmother and father have been split up for i don't know a month or two now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they've been married for something like six months now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> my sister and i both wanted to tell her ahead of time that she's making a horrible mistake but <VOCNOISE> she wouldn't have listened to us so we didn't bother telling her <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they're coming up and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh there has been like divorce papers and stuff ah <UNKNOWN> and i knew that <SIL> police officers are occasionally used to deliver important documents <VOCNOISE> i don't personally think that divorce documents are that important <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> nothing's beyond the realm of possibility for people take things way out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> way too seriously <VOCNOISE> yes <IVER>
yes <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> there's nobody at home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so i just figured <VOCNOISE> something weird's going on i didn't know what was going on but at the same time <VOCNOISE> it was all divorce related <VOCNOISE> just <SIL> basically dumb <VOCNOISE> because <SIL> the divorce wasn't going to faze me because <SIL> the entire marriage was <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we knew <HES-we> knew from the beginning it was a dumb idea <VOCNOISE> and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable <VOCNOISE> so we're just kind of waiting around going oh they're gonna be divorced in a couple months <VOCNOISE> and sure enough so anyway <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <EXT-so> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i look at these people and their names are the <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> and so the <EXCLUDE-name> are coming forward with two police officers behind them <VOCNOISE> and mister <EXCLUDE-name> is kind of a large gentleman and he's way too somber <NOISE-for> <NOISE-this> experience and <VOCNOISE> if you have to like be that somber about something as stupid as a divorce i'm going to give you some sort of shit for it <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> at the <NOISE-same> <NOISE-time> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> um mrs <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> used to be a principal of mine elementary school <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh my stepmother's <IVER>
mother <VOCNOISE> used to be a principal of mine in elementary school <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh he's like <EXCLUDE-name> <HES-I> think we should talk <SIL> was like <SIL> okay great <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> okay so i was like <ERROR-ho=oh> boy you're way too serious for this particular affair <VOCNOISE> okay that's <ERROR-sine=fine> <VOCNOISE> we knew ahead of time this also coming to an end don't worry about it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i <EXT-I> <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for <VOCNOISE> i don't know where that is <SIL> i never found it never saw it never it it's <VOCNOISE> anyway <SIL> not relevant at all the story but <VOCNOISE> it bugs me every time i tell the story because <VOCNOISE> doesn't exist <VOCNOISE> anyway <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> we come back inside and he's like well i've got some bad news and my sister's like <SIL> why <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-ae=and> like all <SIL> okay go ahead <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and he's like <SIL> no i <CUTOFF-thi=think> i think you should sit down i'm like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
all right <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
at at this point <HES-I> <HES-I> stopped for moment i'm just like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-so> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> nobody can think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> their divorce was so important that i need to sit down to deal with it because <HES-I> <HES-I> obviously <VOCNOISE> i <HES-I> i have the curiosity that something whack is <HES-uh> <SIL> is uh <SIL> is afoot <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-and> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-tso=so> i <VOCNOISE> okay <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i sit down <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> say <VOCNOISE> your your father killed himself this morning <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i said <SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> and then there's like <HES-a> sort of a whited out <SIL> period there so <VOCNOISE> you don't get like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> decent details on on what occurred i <NOISE-don't> <NOISE-actually> think anything exciting occurred <VOCNOISE> i think mostly it's me and <SIL> my sister on my lap <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and me smelling my sister's <SIL> wet <SIL> stinky hair <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because it smelled of cigarette smoke for some reason <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> wet stinky hair <VOCNOISE> wet because i was crying into it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-and> <EXT-um> <SIL> and then more time passes so some <CUTOFF-in=indeterminate> indeterminate length of time <VOCNOISE> later <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i i look over at the police officer who's <SIL> standing on one side and the cops are there basically to make sure i don't freak out <VOCNOISE> and that's finally sunk in i was like <VOCNOISE> the cops are here so you don't freak <SIL> and like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh i'm not really in any danger of freaking out <SIL> am i <SIL> then you're <LAUGH> and <UNKNOWN> was like <VOCNOISE> what would freaking out look like <VOCNOISE> you would never know <VOCNOISE> that's why the cops are here oh <LAUGH-okay> <LAUGH-cool> <LAUGH-that> <LAUGH-makes> <LAUGH-more> <LAUGH-sense> <LAUGH-then> <VOCNOISE> i was like okay so <SIL> i looked there's a cop i said <SIL> i have a friend <SIL> upstairs and i wasn't able to put on anything more than that <SIL> and it <NOISE-didn't> come out <NOISE-anywhere> near that well <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> managed get that much information out <VOCNOISE> so the other cop goes upstairs and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> chris <SIL> chris's interpretation of the story at this point is <VOCNOISE> one moment i'm cheerfully playing on the computer and the next moment <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <NOISE> i turn around there's a large police <LAUGH-officer> <LAUGH-ih=in> <LAUGH-doorway> of your room <VOCNOISE> he said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> hi <SIL> <LAUGH> he said i think you should come downstairs <VOCNOISE> they don't tell chris anything <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so chris comes downstairs and he <NOISE-stands> beside me <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and the cops on <UNKNOWN-the-other> side of chris <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and now chris is just <SIL> <NOISE> near me trying to be <SIL> near me has no idea what <NOISE> the hell is going on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <LAUGH> <HES-I> i this <SIL> this sinks into <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> i was like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE-you> <SIL> you <SIL> don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> did they tell <CUTOFF-y=you> <CUTOFF-y=you> any <SIL> <CUTOFF-d=do> you <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he said <SIL> i have no idea what's going on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and i couldn't <NOISE-do> anything about <VOCNOISE> i couldn't tell him i couldn't communicate i was <VOCNOISE> totally <LAUGH-incapable> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <UNKNOWN-and> <IVER>
well the <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> communication wasn't there <IVER>
yeah well there wasn't even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it it just <NOISE> there was nothing there there was no ability to communicate there was a <VOCNOISE> he needs to know this piece of information at the same <NOISE-time> there's no way i could tell it to him so <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> is like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> so i'm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah you don't know and there's <NOISE> nothing else to do about it and continue on merrily and he's i he said eventually he said it was some time later when i actually found out <LAUGH-what> <LAUGH-was> going on i said i had some suspicions <VOCNOISE> because you can do a quick party count and figure out who's not there and assume something bad has happened but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um but <SIL> he said <SIL> but it <NOISE> was a while before i found out actually <SIL> so <SIL> so we can stop <SIL> we can stop the story here or we can go on because this story <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> it's a fun story but <IVER>
okay <EXT-so> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> chris and i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-uh> spent <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the rest of the evening <SIL> calling people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> i got it in my head that i didn't want anybody to call and to say how's your dad doing <VOCNOISE> and so the best way to deal with that situation was to call <SIL> <EXT-globally> <VOCNOISE> cross the board <VOCNOISE> plus it was a fun psychological experiment just <VOCNOISE> as <SIL> as they go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> cause <VOCNOISE> how often do you get to tell <LAUGH-people> <LAUGH> your dad just killed himself this <SIL> morning <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <EXT-I> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-I> <SIL> <EXT-hi> how you doing <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> no i haven't talked to you in a little while is everything going okay <VOCNOISE> <SIL> actually no my <SIL> my father killed himself this <SIL> morning <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you're kidding <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> you you end up <VOCNOISE> after a dozen or so people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> narrowing it down <VOCNOISE> you've got you're kidding <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you're not serious <SIL> <EXT-no> <IVER>
<EXT-really> <VOCNOISE> oh my god <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then you can hash mark them if you want we didn't but you could <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> we had two people who who <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> said <VOCNOISE> you're kidding <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then said <VOCNOISE> <SIL> never mind i'm sorry pretend i never even said that <SIL> i was like <SIL> wow <SIL> somebody must've done this before <LAUGH> because everybody is just like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's no other response <VOCNOISE> but <IVER>
<ERROR-thi=there's> so there's there's no faulting i mean these folks but <SIL> still there's nothing else do and there's nothing creative in response to say to this experience so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you end up with you're kidding again and again and again <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you had two individuals who said you're kidding and then immediately following it <CUTOFF-ya=you're> <UNKNOWN-like> <SIL> never mind pretend i never <NOISE-that> that <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh yeah <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
