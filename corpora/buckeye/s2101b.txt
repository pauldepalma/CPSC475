<VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> at the beginning he did <SIL> perfectly but now he's doing this <VOCNOISE> i want up at four o'clock kind of thing <VOCNOISE> and you give him a bottle and he goes back to sleep but <VOCNOISE> yknow i don't want to walk all way <LAUGH-downstairs> to make bottle for him at <SIL> four o'clock <VOCNOISE> it's like i can't see feeling my way through the hallways and stuff <IVER>

<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>

no i think we're only friends inside the class i mean <VOCNOISE> a lot of them i've known <CUTOFF-f=for> <VOCNOISE> um from middle school and following them up and yknow they just all go their different ways <VOCNOISE> like the one girl i was friends with at world park <VOCNOISE> i mean she was a grade lower than me but when that we seen each other in the halls like hey what's up and <VOCNOISE> and we'd <SIL> talk and <SIL> yknow what's going on and <SIL> we're doing this after school and that <VOCNOISE> in high school <VOCNOISE> i didn't <VOCNOISE> know anything i <SIL> i know she was <SIL> bad <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and that was it <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> that was all i knew <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and it it's kind of weird because <SIL> you <VOCNOISE> when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period <VOCNOISE> and i see them like <SIL> what are you doing that for <IVER>
you're grounded oh <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
what'd you do <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> oh god yknow <CUTOFF-a=I> i feel like a <CUTOFF-p=parent> <VOCNOISE> i was a parent before i was a parent yknow <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> i've <SIL> that's the way it felt it was like <VOCNOISE> some of my friends like <VOCNOISE> like this guy i used to hang out with he <SIL> he used to run into lockers <SIL> in high school i'm like <CUTOFF-i=?> that is so kid <IVER>
yeah just to watch the people go <SIL> what did you just do that for yknow <VOCNOISE> and i'm like <VOCNOISE> and what grade are you in <IVER>
and how old are you <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i know like one point in time it's like we don't want to hang out with you crystal i'm like <VOCNOISE> well fine i don't <LAUGH-care> <VOCNOISE> i'll go hang out with them <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> it's like they <VOCNOISE> they still need to do a lot of growing up <IVER>
they <NOISE> <IVER>
most of my friends are <SIL> <LAUGH> they're <CUTOFF-gi=?> they act like kids <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no unfortunately not <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah because i have a like a problem with <SIL> um <SIL> getting to know people yknow like <VOCNOISE> i'm shy at first <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> then it takes yknow a while yknow get to know the person and <VOCNOISE> then i become friends with them <VOCNOISE> it's like for some reason i didn't want to do that <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <IVER>
columbus public <IVER>
oh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
not really <SIL> i mean <SIL> yeah there's some <SIL> little flaws but <IVER>
<SIL> mean <SIL> the way i grew up it was probably like back in the day <SIL> like <SIL> the catholics against the columbus publics <SIL> yknow like <SIL> the richies against the poories <SIL> that's how i kind of see it <SIL> but when i went to northland people were <SIL> think <SIL> northland's like a rich school <SIL> but the way i see it is <SIL> no not really <SIL> i mean we do live in a big <CUTOFF-h=house> <SIL> yknow housed <SIL> area yknow the houses are like huge <SIL> but um <SIL> um <SIL> i mean columbus public <CUTOFF-s=schools> <SIL> they <SIL> they got some work to do too like <SIL> the other night i was watching tv and <SIL> uh <SIL> an elementary school <SIL> overdosed a kid on <SIL> like some <SIL> a <CUTOFF-d=drug> <SIL> i think it was a drug to <SIL> calm him down so he's not so hyper <SIL> and they like <SIL> overdosed him like twice in a day <SIL> and then when he goes home his mom's even overdosing him because he <SIL> they're <SIL> overdosing him <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i mean he's <SIL> he <CUTOFF-w=was>
