<VOCNOISE> i mean to me you're supposed to earn your grade <LAUGH> <IVER>
<NOISE> it's always been my feeling and <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i try to be fair in the way i grade <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> you know it's i try to be as objective as i can <VOCNOISE> sometimes i <VOCNOISE> because i think it's important that people learn how to write <VOCNOISE> i would ask all my classes to write <SIL> an essay or <SIL> short <IVER>
short uh <SIL> essay for for a test <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> but the way that i would grade those would be <SIL> pretty <NOISE-scientific> i <NOISE-think> <VOCNOISE> you know i'd come up with a rubric and i <NOISE-would> say <VOCNOISE> you you need to have <SIL> you need to mention certain things <NOISE-and> i'll give certain <NOISE-points> <NOISE-for> your <NOISE-mentioning> <NOISE-certain> <VOCNOISE> things <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> i've i've never been a <SIL> <NOISE-I've> <NOISE-never> <VOCNOISE> been a teacher where whose had to assign or grade <NOISE-creative> writing <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-I'm_not_sure_I_would_know_how_to_do_that> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH-right> <LAUGH> <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> well <NOISE> when i was teaching <VOCNOISE> taking teacher <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-education> classes here <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and <NOISE-observing> <NOISE> classroom teachers <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> they <VOCNOISE> would always tell me <VOCNOISE> you <NOISE> need to give a grade for class <NOISE-participation> <IVER>
that was always too subjective for <NOISE-ME> <VOCNOISE> i <IVER>
i could not <SIL> see myself <VOCNOISE> doing that and <SIL> and you know <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> how am i going to tell who's <VOCNOISE> yknow trying to butter me up <NOISE> by <VOCNOISE> raising their hand and <VOCNOISE> and asking questions <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i uh yknow i could i just couldn't see doing <NOISE-that> and i was <VOCNOISE> i had enough to worry about and think about <SIL> when i was trying to teach in <LAUGH-class> <VOCNOISE> keep everything else straight <SIL> and also mark down if people are participating uh that was tough <VOCNOISE> i ended up not doing it <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
subjective right <IVER>
right <IVER>
bump <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i know i know well it's good to have that i think it would be good to have that leeway <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but i'm not sure i would trust myself because <VOCNOISE> there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have <NOISE-more> of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others <VOCNOISE> and i wanted to be fair <VOCNOISE> in terms of <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> not cutting down the ones <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> didn't like that much <LAUGH> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> i think teaching band might be fun because <VOCNOISE> i think you <VOCNOISE> only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> whether you <SIL> were <SIL> well behaved yeah and whether you're trying to play your instrument <LAUGH> i i don't think we ever got a's b's and c's <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <SIL> the competition <NOISE-aspect> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> you played saxophone in the band <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
do you have one now <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
oh that's good <SIL> that's good <IVER>
well i can tell you some community bands that could use you <LAUGH> yeah yeah <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the one <SIL> that's <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> god <IVER>
shawn's in yeah <VOCNOISE> uh huh <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> uh we don't have enough saxophones <VOCNOISE> sure we could use you <LAUGH> <IVER>
huh <VOCNOISE> oh well <IVER>
we're having like three concerts the next month <LAUGH> <IVER>
right right <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> i i like playing that band <VOCNOISE> mostly because <VOCNOISE> the director is <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> he's a his dad is teaches trumpet here at ohio state <VOCNOISE> and he is uh <VOCNOISE> he likes to challenge us <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and it's not so much in the summer in the summer <VOCNOISE> we end up playing marches and <VOCNOISE> stuff that <SIL> popular favorites <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right but during the rest of the year a lot of times <NOISE-we'll> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-play> <SIL> really <NOISE> really um <VOCNOISE> challenging and interesting band music <VOCNOISE> and you don't always get the opportunity to do that <VOCNOISE> in uh <VOCNOISE> musical groups <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator of <VOCNOISE> what they <VOCNOISE> expect the audience to want to hear <LAUGH> <IVER>
<SIL> well <VOCNOISE> i play actually in two orchestras <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> symphony <VOCNOISE> and in the <EXCLUDE-name> orchestra <VOCNOISE> which is an all <SIL> amateur group <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> it's <SIL> it's actually <VOCNOISE> there were <NOISE-times> uh when i was <VOCNOISE> i've been in that group for <SIL> maybe seven or eight years now <VOCNOISE> there have been times when i've been in <NOISE-that> group that have <VOCNOISE> i have <VOCNOISE> thought <SIL> it had a really wretched sound <LAUGH> because they don't have auditions they just take anybody that wants to play <VOCNOISE> and if you take a <VOCNOISE> string player that can't play in tune it can really wreck everything <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> but uh i think we've improved a lot uh we we gave a concert <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> a couple weeks ago <VOCNOISE> at a church in upper arlington <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i thought it went pretty well <VOCNOISE> one piece a little bit of mozart <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> some concertos <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> that was fun <LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> it depends <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> i'd like to do new stuff <VOCNOISE> but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> in the <VOCNOISE> <EXCLUDE-name> symphony <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> unfortunately they tend to have budget problems <SIL> um <SIL> because a lot of the people in that group are paid <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> um-hum <NOISE> i get <NOISE> i get <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=?> paid it's kind of semi professional <SIL> <CUTOFF-ae_s=aspect> <SIL> aspect thing where you <VOCNOISE> get paid per service <VOCNOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> let's see <VOCNOISE> so they have to uh balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for <VOCNOISE> with the amount of music that <SIL> they want to do <LAUGH> and uh <VOCNOISE> this last year we played a <SIL> movement of the shuman concert piece for four horns and orchestra <VOCNOISE> and i was a little bit <SIL> flabbergasted when i saw that on the schedule <VOCNOISE> at the beginning of the year because <NOISE> it's <SIL> really <NOISE-hard> to play <VOCNOISE> and i thought <VOCNOISE> is he expecting <SIL> us to play this the solos <VOCNOISE> or is he expecting to bring in somebody <LAUGH> <IVER>
well as it turned out he expected <SIL> us to play the solos <LAUGH> or <SIL> didn't play the whole piece we only played one movement of it <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> i thought it came out pretty well i have a <SIL> recording of it <VOCNOISE> for a while there i was worried that we didn't get a recording of it and i was <SIL> really upset <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> just one concert <IVER>
i know <IVER>
i know that's why you have to get it recorded <LAUGH> <SIL> <NOISE-it> <VOCNOISE> it would be nice to have more than one concert <SIL> but uh <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> they <SIL> they just <SIL> they're on a shoestring <VOCNOISE> they really are <VOCNOISE> they get most of their money i think by <NOISE> well <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-probably> if you count <SIL> in kind contribution <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> <CUTOFF-w_eh_s_t_er=Westerville> uh otterbein college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> uh <SIL> <SIL> salary the conductor <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> so that's a <SIL> huge an amount of <NOISE> money <VOCNOISE> they put into it <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> what we have to <VOCNOISE> give <NOISE-them> in return is <SIL> <NOISE> an opportunity for <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-people> to play <NOISE-in> <NOISE-orchestra> <VOCNOISE> so uh sometimes we have <CUTOFF-s_t_uw=students> <NOISE> college students play in the orchestra <VOCNOISE> especially string players because they <NOISE-don't> have a <VOCNOISE> college orchestra <VOCNOISE> uh but once in a while we'll get wind players play in it <SIL> also <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> sometimes <NOISE-it> leads to a little bit of friction <VOCNOISE> when <VOCNOISE> they get to play something you wanted to play <LAUGH> <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> most the time it's not it's not bad <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so there's there's that it's an <NOISE> opportunity for <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> musicians in the college to play in an orchestra <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> and what else do they get out of it <VOCNOISE> i don't know prestige a suppose <LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
they <IVER>
don't get <CUTOFF-f=federal> i don't think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council <VOCNOISE> and they <VOCNOISE> they raise money from the businesses <NOISE-in> the community <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-plus> <VOCNOISE> we charge for tickets <LAUGH> for people to come and see us <VOCNOISE> and sometimes it's <NOISE> sometimes we get a lot <VOCNOISE> sometimes we don't get so many <VOCNOISE> turns out the concerts we get the most <VOCNOISE> the biggest audience for <VOCNOISE> are the <VOCNOISE> christmas concerts where we have children's <NOISE-choir> <LAUGH> because <IVER>
yes yeah <LAUGH> <LAUGH-thats> right <VOCNOISE> you can't get a <NOISE-seat> there <LAUGH>
