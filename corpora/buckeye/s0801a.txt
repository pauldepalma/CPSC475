<SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
ok <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
great <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
sure <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i grew up in lima ohio <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and which is only about an hour and half from here <SIL> north <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i came here in <SIL> nineteen ninety one i believe <SIL> <VOCNOISE> here being columbus <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i got married about three years ago <SIL> and right now i'm in the process of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> doing a little bit of everything i've worked all my life <VOCNOISE> um until about the <SIL> past <SIL> <VOCNOISE> two years <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i've just been working like part time <SIL> and um doing crafts and things like that <SIL> because i've always been like in the financial <SIL> analytical end and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the other side of my brain wants some work <IVER>
<SIL> so really that's about it i have a dog <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he's outside right now and that's it <SIL> for my kids <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<SIL> um really anything <SIL> like right now i'm just painting and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um they laugh at me because i went the other day and found some chairs that were <SIL> that <SIL> badly <VOCNOISE> and asked if i could have them cleaned them up <SIL> and i'm painting those and things like that <SIL> so <IVER>
<SIL> no <IVER>
no <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i gave them to my sister and my mom and stuff like that <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> it's kind of fun <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
yeah no that'd be neat i'd love to do that <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <SIL> yeah <SIL> that would be fun <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm looking for a part time job as we speak i've been like doing temporary on and off <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the thing with that is you could work <SIL> yknow for four five months and then nothing <SIL> and then <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just <SIL> like that so right now i'm looking for something permanent <IVER>
uh mostly accounting <SIL> things like that uh such as accounts receivable for nursing homes and <VOCNOISE> things like that pretty in depth <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> some of the day by yknow if i just go for a day it's filing and what not getting phones <VOCNOISE> but most of the jobs actually <SIL> you learn a lot <SIL> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> boy it would have to be <SIL> um something that i actually enjoy <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <CUTOFF-w=what> <CUTOFF-w=what> <SIL> what happened was ever since i came to columbus <VOCNOISE> almost every company i work for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i wasn't interested in that <SIL> uh because my husband works for the state <VOCNOISE> so obviously he's not going anywhere <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so i got tired of that and that's why i kind of went to temping and stuff <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so it'd be one with a variety <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i'm <CUTOFF-unfort=unfortunately> i say unfortunately good at accounting and stuff <VOCNOISE> but that doesn't get to express my creative side as much so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it would be um <SIL> my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people as well <VOCNOISE> and like <SIL> would do presentations at seminars and stuff like that occasionally too <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
just a teeny bit <IVER>
enough to satisfy me <VOCNOISE> so that was good <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i do <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i prefer <SIL> i've done it by myself but i would <ERROR-pf=prefer> prefer to do it with my husband <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and stuff <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> europe <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i was there for almost a month <VOCNOISE> did one of those tours where you get on the bus <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and did the london and the france the and italy and to holland and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> germany and everything <SIL> that was really neat <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> that's very true <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> we haven't done that much yet uh because his family lives in albuquerque new mexico <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> we're <SIL> at <CUTOFF-a=at> at least every other year we're out there <IVER>
which is great <IVER>
but it takes away that big trip <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um we've been and then his brother got married in hawaii <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so we went out there so <SIL> we've just done the honeymoon at disney world <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the albuquerque a couple times and hawaii <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but we have plans to go to europe he he wants to go to england and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> things like that and i wanna we're looking into greece <IVER>
so <IVER>
<SIL> yes <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh actually kawai <SIL> yeah so it was really nice <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i thought it <VOCNOISE> course i didn't go to all of them but <SIL> it was nice <IVER>
yeah <SIL> and it it has the least amount of people <SIL> which is kind of neat <SIL> as far as tourism <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not bothering me but when i talk and move my head <IVER>
it's like hitting me and i just am not sure you can tell me if it's not <SIL> <VOCNOISE> anywhere near my mouth <IVER>
<SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> it's i keep it wasn't <SIL> but then it moved so <SIL> well <SIL> there we go <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> hilliard <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i like it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> i've lived <VOCNOISE> i've only lived in the northern end i've lived in dublin <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and old worthington <VOCNOISE> and now hilliard which is kind of around the side <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um but i like it because it has it's own little <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well especially worthington it's own little city within a city <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> i think they have a lot to do <SIL> yknow the parks and things like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> um <SIL> i'll just hold it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but i like it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because it has art <SIL> and culture <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it doesn't feel like a big city <IVER>
unless you get stuck in traffic <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah but i <CUTOFF-bu=but> <SIL> i have <SIL> purposely tried to work close <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or do the back roads it's nice from hilliard you can get almost anywhere <VOCNOISE> <SIL> whether it be here <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or yknow where i've been working <SIL> on back roads so it's not that bad <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yes <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
the snouffer and all that <SIL> yep <IVER>
i used to live up there too <IVER>
so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
very much so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i think this year it's gonna be even worse <SIL> stocking up <SIL> water <SIL> <LAUGH-no> <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yes <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
yes <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> really <SIL> i haven't noticed that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yet <SIL> huh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think it's probably too though that a lot of people haven't <SIL> aren't used to it <SIL> i mean they're not from ohio <VOCNOISE> i've <CUTOFF-f=found> <SIL> found that in columbus a lot <SIL> so they're kind of <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow more tentative or they're from the south or something like that <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but <SIL> i've noticed that a lot of people <SIL> rarely do you meet people born and raised in columbus <SIL> so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
huh <IVER>
that's good <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no not really actually <SIL> <CUTOFF-so=some> some i have and then i've run into the people that <SIL> just like anything they wanna get out of their hometown they don't like it they complain <VOCNOISE> but normally i find that those people <SIL> aren't taking advantage of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the <SIL> yknow free art shows and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i mean the things that are free i'm like oh have you done this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no i didn't even know about it and you've lived here all your life and i've only lived here x number of years and <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> well just even like the <SIL> parks <IVER>
or um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like the <SIL> art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the the irish festival in dublin <VOCNOISE> which can be free yeah on certain days and things like that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> the concerts on the river <SIL> or on the worthington <SIL> green <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> really anything like that <IVER>
and they used to have the laser light show downtown <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-the=they> they don't have it anymore <SIL> um yknow just even if you do one thing free a month <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it <SIL> it doesn't have to cost anything but you <SIL> you can go do it with your family or whatever so <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE>
