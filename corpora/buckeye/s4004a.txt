whether <VOCNOISE> they're play a video game where <VOCNOISE> they're shooting people <SIL> i can't say they <SIL> see that as being something that affects them <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
once they turn into adulthood and <SIL> they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i don't think that <SIL> has anything to do with it <IVER>
no i mean <SIL> like said i think little kids are <CUTOFF-r=really?> gonna be little kids if that stuff wasn't on tv they're still gonna act the same way <VOCNOISE> they're still gonna be <SIL> walk around with toy guns things like that <VOCNOISE> playing war or whatever <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i think it's probably <VOCNOISE> some of both <VOCNOISE> i think it's probably more <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean <EXT-obviously> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they are gonna have different views on how things work <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i mean for the most part <SIL> i can't see that as <SIL> being too big of a problem <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that then there are women <VOCNOISE> but at the same time <SIL> i wouldn't say there's anything too <SIL> over powerful as far's the <SIL> the number of guys being out there <VOCNOISE> are violent i mean it's something <SIL> that <SIL> unfortunately does happen but i mean <EXT-it's> <SIL> more how you're brought up whether you can control it or not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
all right
