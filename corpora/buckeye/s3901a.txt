<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes um <VOCNOISE> undergraduate <SIL> student <IVER>
first year <VOCNOISE> finishing it up <VOCNOISE> oh yeah <VOCNOISE> oh it's definitely the <VOCNOISE> the beginning <LAUGH> <IVER>
the beginning of the end <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yep <VOCNOISE> um grew up in upper arlington <VOCNOISE> not far <VOCNOISE> yeah really those five miles make such a difference though <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> because i yeah because i live on campus <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i live in uh siebert hall <SIL> oh yeah i got <VOCNOISE> i think there are a hundred and seventy of us here for just from my class alone <IVER>
uh four twenty five <IVER>
yeah it's been like that every year basically <IVER>
yeah it's usually like about a third or something <VOCNOISE> <EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> i think maybe two thirds of them live on campus <VOCNOISE> it's just basically getting out of the house <IVER>
<EXT-um> <VOCNOISE> just to get away from my parents for a while <VOCNOISE> yknow and it's kind of good for me just to be away <VOCNOISE> it's part of the experience <VOCNOISE> like learning do my own laundry and stuff i used <UNKNOWN> so bad about it and now all of a sudden <VOCNOISE> i'm <VOCNOISE> don't care really <IVER>
i i don't care about like having to do it <VOCNOISE> like my mom even wants me to do hers over summer i'm like okay <VOCNOISE> fine <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i think so <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> met quite a few people from cleveland <VOCNOISE> and then my roommate is from north canton <IVER>
no not really um all my good friends from <VOCNOISE> well i'd say like <VOCNOISE> out of all my good friends from high school one of them no two of them are still here <IVER>
um i do so much just <VOCNOISE> not uh one of them i see just got <VOCNOISE> back from lunch with i mean i see him <IVER>
every day the other one i don't see that much anymore <IVER>
um well <VOCNOISE> she's got a boyfriend so she's busy <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and she lives off campus too <SIL> so <SIL> she lives out in hilliard actually it's far <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah she had an apartment in arlington and so they wanted to get an actual house <IVER>
so they built one out in hilliard <IVER>
yeah she still lives with family <IVER>
um um <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um huh <IVER>
um <LAUGH> well the opinion kind of like the general consensus around upper arlington is that o s u is not a good enough school <IVER>
for everybody so you've you want to go to ivy league you don't even want to look here <IVER>
yknow so <VOCNOISE> they offered to accept me to med school here <IVER>
okay <IVER>
i'll stay <VOCNOISE> yeah i'm in a uh <VOCNOISE> in the guinea pig class of this program through the medical school where after three years of undergrad i go to med school here <VOCNOISE> like without m cats or anything <IVER>
um i get a <VOCNOISE> b s which they <VOCNOISE> mail to me after first year of <VOCNOISE> medical school <VOCNOISE> like they figure that uh gross anatomy and all that's enough <IVER>
biology experience <IVER>
actually i do wasn't even that sure that i wanted to do it until um <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> senior year and the opportunity came up and i said to her oh <VOCNOISE> this sounds cool <VOCNOISE> yknow i had thought of myself as a uh a chemist <VOCNOISE> for a long time <VOCNOISE> and that this opportunity came up <VOCNOISE> yeah i'd applied to <VOCNOISE> like other places and i got into university of chicago <VOCNOISE> and i wanted to go there and then <VOCNOISE> this came up here and also i mean <VOCNOISE> it's just ridiculously cheaper here i didn't want <VOCNOISE> debt after <LAUGH-undergrad> that's just pathetic <VOCNOISE> um my counselor just kind of found it and he'd posted it and he specially <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> tried to notify the national merit people about it <VOCNOISE> and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school <VOCNOISE> they all <VOCNOISE> one of them is at princeton right now <VOCNOISE> yknow and they're <VOCNOISE> all off at their ivy leagues <VOCNOISE> like basically working their butts off to <VOCNOISE> get in when <VOCNOISE> i'm already in <VOCNOISE> i don't totally understand it <IVER>
yeah ohio state is like a really good medical school i don't <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think they just mainly didn't want to go to o s u like their egos or something yknow <VOCNOISE> i'm thinking of one in particular yknow rich parents just <VOCNOISE> wanted to go somewhere else <IVER>
yeah he they could afford to go there so they did <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i think <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the people who have already graduated they're like the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation <VOCNOISE> like among adults it's just that the kids want to go <VOCNOISE> it it's just thought of as a somewhat party school <IVER>
i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> within the honors program i think there's some really really exceptional things going on <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> one of the requirements is we have to been in the honors college during undergraduate <VOCNOISE> and <UNKNOWN> fulfill all the requirements there <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um you get priority for scheduling <VOCNOISE> you have to apply for it like seperately and i think you have to have like certain <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> class standing and s a t scores <VOCNOISE> or you can write an essay and they'll let you in anyways <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> let's see <VOCNOISE> you get <VOCNOISE> priority <VOCNOISE> for scheduling the i think you go after <VOCNOISE> varsity athletes and disabilities and that's it <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> i think they do <IVER>
yeah they do <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> let's see <VOCNOISE> you have to complete either a thesis <VOCNOISE> or a contract which just consists of taking lots of honors classes <IVER>
and they have honors classes which are separate and <VOCNOISE> they're supposed to be with like better faculty and um <VOCNOISE> smaller class size and a little more challenging <IVER>
my honor's class is challenging and organic <SIL> chemistry is very challenging but <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
no it's not <IVER>
it's <VOCNOISE> regular's enough for me in that <VOCNOISE> and i didn't have <VOCNOISE> i couldn't schedule the honors <IVER>
yes they do <IVER>
uh i almost think the honors would be better just because of smaller class size i have like four hundred in my class right now <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> it kind of helps actually because uh <VOCNOISE> you have all the people in there who are not honors and they don't know how to <CUTOFF-s=study> like the partiers they don't know how to study or anything so <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
it helps the curve <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i have to take organic i have to take um <VOCNOISE> biology chemistry physics <VOCNOISE> and then um i have to complete a major <VOCNOISE> if it's biology i get a break i don't uh i only have to take twenty nine hours of it <IVER>
but other ones you have take the full major <VOCNOISE> yknow some people are doing uh <VOCNOISE> gosh i think one's doing business and one's doing economics and <IVER>
i think they're doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided to take the easy road <IVER>
hm um early admission pathway <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
there <EXT-are> <VOCNOISE> fifteen <IVER>
yeah um the medical school has pretty much limited them to ten percent of the
