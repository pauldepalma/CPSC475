<IVER>
oh <CUTOFF-the=they> well they knew <SIL> all <CUTOFF-d=different> all different things <SIL> i mean i mean culturally <VOCNOISE> yknow it was different <VOCNOISE> different music it was it <CUTOFF-w=was?> <SIL> course i'm i'm <SIL> in a suburban high school in cincinnati you didn't get exposed to much <SIL> uh so that <CUTOFF-wa=was> that was the <SIL> <CUTOFF-b=biggest> <SIL> the biggest thing <SIL> well and of course they talk funny <SIL> in the east but <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> other than that other than the culture shock <SIL> um <SIL> it wasn't <SIL> it wasn't that different <IVER>
yeah if i had <SIL> um <SIL> if i had stayed for the i i didn't graduate so if i'd stayed for the fourth year <SIL> um when we did a lot would do a lot of um <SIL> uh <SIL> uh <SIL> making up a portfolio that kind of thing <SIL> um <SIL> i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i <CUTOFF-pro=probably> i would've <SIL> i probably would've stayed <SIL> but <SIL> it was <IVER>
yeah <SIL> oh yeah yeah i liked it a lot <SIL> um <SIL> but it was it was nineteen seventy and there was kent state and <LAUGH-there_was> <VOCNOISE> yknow all that stuff going on and it just <VOCNOISE> school just didn't seem that important <LAUGH> <SIL> <SIL> and also i think i think this happens to a lot of people as they approach senior year and say oh my god yknow i'm gonna graduate and then i'm gonna have to be a grownup <VOCNOISE> ok <SIL> i won't graduate <LAUGH> <IVER>

<SIL> i mean i i <CUTOFF-n=know?> i don't know <CUTOFF-en=enough> i enough about it to really say but it <SIL> i <SIL> can't <SIL> i mean it <VOCNOISE> i don't know where they got that <IVER>
<SIL> i <SIL> yknow maybe i'm oblivious to things but i mean i mean seems like there's <SIL> lot of worse places <IVER>
<SIL> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <cutoff=from> from my <VOCNOISE> perspective which is skewed of course <SIL> to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was <VOCNOISE> we're only talking about ten cases that's not very many <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-tha=that?> i mean <SIL> you could by coincidence <SIL> have them all be african american <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective <SIL> and i yknow i don't <SIL> don't live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> yknow i just don't <SIL> i'm <CUTOFF-no=not> i'm not in touch with it <SIL> with that situation <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no we're pretty white <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-kn=know?> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> among the people i know <SIL> i <CUTOFF-think?> i <SIL> yknow we're <CUTOFF-ex=?> <SIL> i <CUTOFF-th=think> i think it's a pretty tolerant city <SIL> um <SIL> uh <SIL> i know a lot of people who live <SIL> down in old town <SIL> yknow in a very <SIL> ah diverse environment and um <SIL> um <SIL> yknow i just <SIL> i just don't i don't personally know any racists i don't think <SIL> <IVER>
i'm sure i'm sure it is <SIL> yknow it's just the circles i move in <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah yeah yeah i it surprises me to <CUTOFF-hea=hear> to find that that columbus is is so out of shape <SIL> um <SIL> but i'm <SIL> in the i <SIL> well yknow in the circles that i move in <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> everybody is very <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> middle aged and they all quit <LAUGH-smoking_and_they're_all_all_of> the sudden trying to beat off the reaper <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i mean i mean <SIL> well and course they were always hippies and ate sprouts and <SIL> twigs and leaves <SIL> anyway <SIL> yknow so <CUTOFF-th=that's> <SIL> yknow that's the sort of circles i move in but i know <SIL> because i <CUTOFF-ta=take?> have these part time jobs from time to time <SIL> i see a a whole different <SIL> group of people <SIL> and i can say it's <SIL> probably true <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah_yeah> <SIL> <LAUGH-word_word> <IVER>
yeah so i <CUTOFF-tha=that> i mean that <SIL> probably <SIL> circles i move in is what's <SIL> coloring my whole view of columbus <SIL> i mean there's <SIL> a lot <CUTOFF-th=there's> i'm sure there's a lot i don't <SIL> know <IVER>
oh yeah <SIL> yeah and i <CUTOFF-th=think> i think i think even even <SIL> if you're aware of everything that's here you still <SIL> in the back of your mind you just have that <SIL> it's <CUTOFF-Colu=Columbus> it's just columbus it's just columbus <SIL> ah maybe it's because <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> people don't <SIL> take advantage of <CUTOFF-w=what's> <SIL> don't realize what's actually here <SIL> um <SIL> don't realize how it <SIL> i mean yeah it's not chicago <SIL> it's not new york <SIL> it's not <LAUGH-San_Fransico> there's a lot of places it's not <SIL> but it's <CUTOFF-n=not> <SIL> ah <SIL> yknow it's not a backwater either <SIL> well they need to get out more <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_mean> yknow all this <SIL> oh we'll never be a major league city until we have major league sports <UNKNOWN-is_a?> <SIL> well <CUTOFF-I=I> yknow i guess <SIL> um getting out more wouldn't help those <LAUGH-people> <SIL> it's um <SIL> ah <SIL> that that would be <CUTOFF-th=the?> <SIL> yknow that would be such a small <SIL> part <SIL> of <SIL> of <SIL> civilization anywhere <SIL> for me <SIL> and um <SIL> i'm pretty pleased with the way <SIL> things are moving along and i just <SIL> i'd <SIL> i'm <SIL> i really do think people don't take advantage of it <SIL> the way they should <IVER>
<SIL> i think so <IVER>
