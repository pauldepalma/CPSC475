<VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> objectives in vietnam <VOCNOISE> were never <VOCNOISE> clearly delineated <IVER>
and they were in italy <VOCNOISE> and europe <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> there wasn't <VOCNOISE> the definite <VOCNOISE> enemy <VOCNOISE> in vietnam that there was in europe <VOCNOISE> i think that's part of it <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> and of course the attitude of most of the <VOCNOISE> guys that went to vietnam was <VOCNOISE> a little bit different from <VOCNOISE> from where i was probably is a consequence of <VOCNOISE> our understanding of the <VOCNOISE> the uh <IVER>
objectives <VOCNOISE> because uh <VOCNOISE> when we went <NOISE> into the service and then went overseas our <VOCNOISE> objective was to <VOCNOISE> do away with hitler and mussolini <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know they <VOCNOISE> i'm just thankful that he <VOCNOISE> he wasn't in a <VOCNOISE> carrying a rifle in a rifle company or something because <VOCNOISE> that was rough <IVER>
<NOISE> he uh <VOCNOISE> told he never said much about it except he <VOCNOISE> told about <VOCNOISE> one time when he was in the <VOCNOISE> hospital <VOCNOISE> up in japan <VOCNOISE> after he was burned <VOCNOISE> he said that he was in a <VOCNOISE> ward with a bunch of other <VOCNOISE> burn patients and <VOCNOISE> and he said the <VOCNOISE> some of them and him included <VOCNOISE> were able to get up and walk around <VOCNOISE> so the <VOCNOISE> and i can see their philosophy the <VOCNOISE> medics <VOCNOISE> had the guys that could walk <VOCNOISE> help wait on the <VOCNOISE> guys that were bed bound <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> he was <VOCNOISE> had been helping <VOCNOISE> one guy that was <VOCNOISE> pretty bad off <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> and this guy passed away <VOCNOISE> didn't make it <VOCNOISE> and so they <VOCNOISE> started to put orrin get warren to <VOCNOISE> do something else <CUTOFF-w=with> <VOCNOISE> with some of the other guys <VOCNOISE> i'm through i'm not working anymore with them he told them <VOCNOISE> and they swore yes you are <VOCNOISE> he said what are you gonna do send me back over to vietnam <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but they sent him home <VOCNOISE> but he was <VOCNOISE> he was uh <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> not a very enthusiastic soldier i don't think at any time and <VOCNOISE> especially after he came home <IVER>
now what <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> i don't think that women should be on the front lines <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> some women <VOCNOISE> are <CUTOFF-phys=phsically> <VOCNOISE> are physically able to do <VOCNOISE> what's needed <VOCNOISE> some definitely aren't <VOCNOISE> of course there's a <VOCNOISE> same by the same token some men aren't <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> as <CUTOFF-a=as> as support <VOCNOISE> groups i think that's all right <IVER>
huh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
i never heard a thing about it all the time i was in the service <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and i don't know <VOCNOISE> whether orrin did or not he's never said anything if he has <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> i think my attitude would be <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> don't tell and <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> the guys that <CUTOFF-co=come> <VOCNOISE> come out in a very <ERROR-vocishou=vociferous> <VOCNOISE> vociferously in favor of <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> publicizing it and all that <VOCNOISE> i don't see <VOCNOISE> what they expect to gain <VOCNOISE> i mean if <VOCNOISE> they <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> they uh <VOCNOISE> in fact i don't <CUTOFF-s=see> <VOCNOISE> i don't think that they do gain anything by it <IVER>
it wasn't publicized to the <VOCNOISE> degree that it is now <VOCNOISE> it seems like anymore nothing is sacred i mean as far as papers are concerned <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> there's something else that i <VOCNOISE> i guess i'm old fashioned but i don't think <VOCNOISE> we need all this publicity about <VOCNOISE> all the sexual escapades of all the <VOCNOISE> people that are <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-notari=notarized?> or <CUTOFF-no=notorious> <VOCNOISE> have <ERROR-notarious=notorious> <VOCNOISE> lives <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i just <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> i think maybe i'm old fashioned but i <VOCNOISE> and they <VOCNOISE> i can hardly <VOCNOISE> conceive <VOCNOISE> anyone being <VOCNOISE> a genuine homosexual <VOCNOISE> i mean evidently they are <VOCNOISE> um but uh <VOCNOISE> it's so against human nature <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> or against conventional human nature anyway <IVER>
well there's been quite a change in attitude of <VOCNOISE> the general public i <ERROR-thinik=think> as far as <ERROR-wri=women_working> <VOCNOISE> work <VOCNOISE> women working away from home is concerned <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i'm glad that my wife <VOCNOISE> was able to work there at home <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> actually she worked in an office when our first boy <VOCNOISE> was just <VOCNOISE> small <IVER>
but uh <VOCNOISE> her mother <VOCNOISE> stayed with us for <VOCNOISE> several uh two or three years <VOCNOISE> and she was a baby sitter for our oldest boy <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> she said well <VOCNOISE> mary would just well go out and get a job <VOCNOISE> she doesn't need to be <VOCNOISE> sit around here <IVER>
i mean that was <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
she was a <VOCNOISE> mary's mother was a <VOCNOISE> kind of a <VOCNOISE> free thinking uh <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> not a liberal but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> well <VOCNOISE> she went out <VOCNOISE> when she was in her early twenties <VOCNOISE> went out to <CUTOFF-n=north> <VOCNOISE> north d or uh <VOCNOISE> north or south dakota one or the other and homesteaded <IVER>
on a homestead <IVER>
and uh <VOCNOISE> then while she was out there <VOCNOISE> she met a <VOCNOISE> a cowboy who <VOCNOISE> was from also from ohio <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> they uh <VOCNOISE> they were married while they were out there i guess <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> she was <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> uh my son <VOCNOISE> used to say she was a piece of work she <LAUGH> she hadn't <VOCNOISE> definite ideas about <CUTOFF-e=everything> <VOCNOISE> pretty near everything <IVER>
