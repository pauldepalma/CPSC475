<IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah as i was teasing <LAUGH-hm> <IVER>
okay <IVER>
twenty eight years <SIL> this is my twenty eighth year <VOCNOISE> i have two more years to go <SIL> and i get to <EXT-retire> <VOCNOISE> and then i'll go <SIL> retrain and probably do something else for another twenty years <IVER>
oh no <SIL> no they move you around all the time when you <ERROR-terch=teach> when you teach kids with learning disabilities <VOCNOISE> they move you to where the population is <SIL> rather than move the kids to you <SIL> so yeah i've been in <VOCNOISE> columbus <SIL> and worthington are the two systems i've been in but <SIL> no though within those <NOISE-systems> they can move you around from school to school <SIL> i've been at the same one now for <SIL> this is my seventh year <SIL> at the middle school <IVER>
it's grace brethren christian middle school it's part of worthington schools cause they annexed <SIL> it <IVER>
i was in columbus for the first like six years i taught <IVER>
back in the <CUTOFF-s=seventies> <SIL> early seventies <SIL> and then i transferred to worthington in seventy six and i've been there ever since <IVER>
<SIL> no i didn't really start out as <SIL> a teacher i started out as a speech and hearing therapist <VOCNOISE> but they kept giving me these kids that <SIL> i couldn't keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them <SIL> so i got interested in the hyper activity and so i started taking classes <VOCNOISE> about any <SIL> kids with <SIL> a d h d and stuff and <VOCNOISE> little by little first thing you know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i had my masters in learning disabilities <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was mostly just so i could <SIL> learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy and then when i found out there were so many openings in special ed <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background <VOCNOISE> <SIL> for l d because <SIL> a lot of these l d kids have language deficits and language problems they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they can't yknow like express themselves on paper <SIL> or they don't <SIL> <CUTOFF-he=hear> <SIL> process things correctly <SIL> auditorially so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's the perfect background <SIL> to work with l d kids <SIL> i didn't know i was doing that at the time but <NOISE> <IVER>
somebody must have been watching over me <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah right i taught <SIL> um <SIL> well i was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever since that i've <SIL> been in <IVER>
uh-huh <SIL> and then when i got my masters <VOCNOISE> no i did it <NOISE> no i did it <VOCNOISE> during <NOISE-um> <NOISE> the weekends <NOISE-and> <NOISE-the> summers <NOISE> and the nights <NOISE> and took me about <SIL> mm <SIL> well i started teaching in nineteen seventy <SIL> seventy one <IVER>
and then <CUTOFF-I=I> i <SIL> got my masters in seventy five <SIL> so it took me four years that way <SIL> no i never <VOCNOISE> i just <CUTOFF-w=was> <SIL> was smart enough to do it before i had kids <IVER>
well i was married but i didn't have any kids once <ERROR-you're=you> have kids <ERROR-you=you're> not gonna be able to do that kind of a schedule <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> yeah so i didn't take off any time <SIL> and then when i <SIL> got my masters i ran into an old friend of mine <VOCNOISE> who <SIL> teaches in worthington and he <VOCNOISE> <SIL> said oh i'm the special ed director up there now we need a resource room <NOISE-teacher> why don't you come up and interview for this position <SIL> or that position or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i went up and interviewed for that position got another position but anyway it all worked <LAUGH-out> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i guess i'd have to say <SIL> i <SIL> don't necessarily like middle school <VOCNOISE> but see when you get a special ed certificate you're certified kindergarten through twelfth <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> i did <SIL> several years in a high school <SIL> when i was first out of college <SIL> i did high school first <SIL> then i went to elementary while <SIL> my kids were in elementary <SIL> so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then <SIL> six years ago i went to the middle school <SIL> and i've decided that <SIL> i'm too old <SIL> to keep up with these kids <SIL> not only are they <SIL> learning disability and a d d but they're middle schoolers <SIL> and they have like hormones running rampant all over the outside of their bodies <SIL> you can't tell which is the hormones and which is the a d d and which is the learning disability <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> like i said i only have two more years to go so i guess i can live through <NOISE-that> <IVER>
that's not my favorite age i guess <IVER>
middle <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
oh yeah they were more settled <IVER>
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade and eleventh they're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they're gonna have to go to college and <VOCNOISE> this is like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the only life they're gonna get yknow they kind of get that realization they start getting serious <VOCNOISE> kids at middle school think everything's just a big joke yknow i'm gonna play in a rock band <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they all think they're gonna be rock stars and drummers and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> yknow they could care less <SIL> about anything it hasn't hit them yet this is my real life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> duh <SIL> this is my one real life <SIL> better not throw it away <VOCNOISE> they waste time yknow <VOCNOISE> they <NOISE-lose> stuff <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it's just middle school i think it's <VOCNOISE> transitioning from childhood <VOCNOISE> to adulthood is a tough time <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> when you have all the other <SIL> things going on like you can't read and you can't write and you can't spell <VOCNOISE> then it's just even worse <ERROR-ik's=it's> <CUTOFF-ek=exacerbated> it's exacerbated even more <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and they <CUTOFF-g=go> <IVER>
oh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't really <LAUGH-think> so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i guess i don't <SIL> i guess i don't <SIL> i don't get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yell and scream at them <CUTOFF-a=and> i mean realize they didn't ask to have a learning disability <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean they and that they can't <SIL> they're not some teachers think they're just being belligerent <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that if they wanted to straighten up they could <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and what i try to tell those teachers is they can't change their learning disability anymore than you can change your brown eyes <SIL> yknow they were born with it it's genetic someone else in their family has it <VOCNOISE> they can learn they just don't learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or teach it a different way it's like teaching a math problem two different ways you get the same answer <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> one way works better for you <SIL> well that's how they are <SIL> yknow maybe they don't learn well by listening <VOCNOISE> <SIL> maybe they don't learn by <CUTOFF-b=by?> well by looking <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ae=at> <SIL> at a chart or something <SIL> maybe they only learn well when they're up moving around doing something <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow you just have to understand that their <VOCNOISE> avenues of learning are like different than yours <SIL> and totally <VOCNOISE> <SIL> some of them <SIL> might be totally screwed up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like they might hear <SIL> half of what you say <SIL> or they might jumble up what you say you say <CUTOFF-p=page?> <SIL> turn to page three ninety three or <VOCNOISE> and they turn to three thirty nine in their book <SIL> yknow and they think they did what you said <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just like something's mixed up between <VOCNOISE> the actual eye and the ear <SIL> and then it where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> for one day in their shoes <SIL> you'd probably have a lot of empathy for them <IVER>
well <IVER>
<CUTOFF-n=no?> actually in order to get in my room you have to <VOCNOISE> be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify as a learning disability kid <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in other <CUTOFF-word=words> <SIL> the way you qualify in the state of <NOISE-Ohio> is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you have a thirty point discrepancy between your actual i q <SIL> and your daily performance in other words <VOCNOISE> <SIL> let's say you have a hundred i q <SIL> but in all of your classes you're performing like a seventy i q person would <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so if there's a thirty point discrepancy in there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ae=and> and <SIL> people see that you're bright <SIL> <CUTOFF-a=and> but yet you're just not <SIL> getting it <VOCNOISE> you're not able to write answers <SIL> like you could say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or you're not able to read things <SIL> that other seventh graders can read <VOCNOISE> that kind of clues us in and then the <SIL> regular ed or somebody refers the child for testing <SIL> and then if they qualify <SIL> for help <SIL> then we <VOCNOISE> yknow they go to my room for certain classes most of my kids i have them for reading and english <IVER>
that's not a shocking surprise <SIL> i mean i rarely get a kid for math although we do have kids that are <SIL> learning disabled and they don't understand math either even though it's very concrete <IVER>
<IVER>
no <CUTOFF-m=math> <CUTOFF-m=math> math is just <SIL> you can say okay here's three blocks you can touch them <SIL> one <SIL> two three take two away now there's one <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah you can't say a noun is always gonna be orange <VOCNOISE> and it's gonna be slippery <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yknow> <LAUGH-what> <LAUGH-I> <LAUGH-mean> <SIL> language is so much more abstract than math and science <VOCNOISE> so the abstract areas like history and <SIL> english and reading and literature that's where these kids have their problems <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because their <SIL> disability is usually rooted in <SIL> somewhere in the languages <VOCNOISE> they either can't write can't read can't spell <SIL> can't do all three <SIL> or aren't very good at any of them <SIL> once in a while you'll see a good speller <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because he can remember the order in which the letters come <SIL> but <SIL> he might be a horrible reader and a horrible <SIL> writer even though he can spell <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah and his comprehension <SIL> of the words of other kids his age wouldn't be <SIL> what it should be <VOCNOISE> generally speaking my kids are two to four years behind
