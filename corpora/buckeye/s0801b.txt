<LAUGH-I_didn't> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> no my husband yeah he's uh he's from she can wear a bandanna but that's it <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and i yknow i would love to do that with her only on things like that i wouldn't be the type that would put a sweater on her on tuesday and a little skirt on her on wednesday <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i i would get a kick out of that <SIL> um <SIL> she <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yes <SIL> um <NOISE> we're both <SIL> i've gotten kind of bad uh <SIL> but my husband's a marathon trainer <SIL> i try to run with her at least two or three times a week because she's he's too fast for her <VOCNOISE> um but we go to like hoffman farms <VOCNOISE> up in <HES-off off of cosgray in hilliard i'm not sure if it's in hilliard but <VOCNOISE> um we've taken her to the scioto part <IVER>
for the concert on the river <VOCNOISE> we don't tend to take her to things like the art festival or the it's just too crowded <IVER>
and it's not fair to her or the other people <IVER>
uh because she has been known to help herself to bread <SIL> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-when> <VOCNOISE> we were like brain dead after this race and my husband took her and we know better but <SIL> we were like <SIL> yknow after you run you're kind of like uh <VOCNOISE> and she <LAUGH-actually> <NOISE> jumped up on the table and looked around and took a piece of bread and i'm like <SIL> oh my gosh <IVER>
you're so embarrassed <VOCNOISE> i'm so sorry and the guy's like ah nobody else is eating it she <LAUGH-might_as_well> <LAUGH> <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she's a golden retriever <SIL> yeah she's three so she's still puppy but she's getting there <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yep <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah she did that yesterday <IVER>
so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> stomach pump <LAUGH-oh> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> we've kind of broken her of that thank goodness the counter stuff <IVER>
but <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> she's been known to do that too <SIL> yeah <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> sure <IVER>
do they <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <IVER>
that's nice <IVER>
that's good <IVER>
right <SIL> yeah <SIL> i've run into just a few problems at antrum <VOCNOISE> um since i do like to jog even though i'm very slow <VOCNOISE> most of the people that take their dogs there <SIL> take them off the leash and let them go in the lake and what not <VOCNOISE> which is <VOCNOISE> <EXT-okay> you're not supposed to do that but when i'm jogging with my dog on a leash and all the other dogs come up it <SIL> irritates me <IVER>
because yknow you're trying to run and your dog's trying to greet that dog and the dog's tripping you and you're like <VOCNOISE> i've actually been known to go am i the only one following the rules around here <UNKNOWN> <LAUGH> <SIL> because i'm trying to run <SIL> <LAUGH-and> obviously it's hard for me to run so <VOCNOISE> oh <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
he will be <SIL> yeah it's a week from sunday <SIL> um-hum <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i would love to do it but <SIL> even when i was <LAUGH-skinny> <VOCNOISE> my knee won't let me <IVER>
i was marathon training and i only got up to about nine miles <VOCNOISE> and um i have <SIL> unfortunately about fifty pounds of extra weight on me but even like i said when i was skinnier <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i have like a bum knee on distance <SIL> i'm okay to run the lower <SIL> but uh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> no <SIL> yknow i should <SIL> i really should i do that with the <LAUGH-dog> <VOCNOISE> without even realizing it but i haven't just because i've ran for so many years <SIL> or <SIL> jogged excuse me i don't <SIL> run i'm too slow <LAUGH> <LAUGH-but> <VOCNOISE> get the track terminology there <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah that's a good idea <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i have read that <SIL> i need to try that <SIL> just for winter even <IVER>
you don't slide as much <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that would be good <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<NOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they're pretty good where i live um <VOCNOISE> well last year when we had that really really high snow <SIL> um i shoveled and then like an hour later it blew over <SIL> so was like what's the <LAUGH-point> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <SIL> our neighborhood has a lot of children so most of the people do shovel their sidewalk <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> about <CUTOFF-si=six> yeah <SIL> did we get her <VOCNOISE> we've had her for two years yeah <SIL> we did about six months <VOCNOISE> we went to hawaii and got his brother married <VOCNOISE> and then we came back we knew that <SIL> would be the last long trip <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and we were gonna wait till the spring but we couldn't <SIL> so we went to a rescue service and got her <SIL> <SIL> <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
oh definitely <SIL> definitely <SIL> well i've never had dog and i've always wanted one <IVER>
so this is my first <SIL> i'm like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> want a <EXT-doggy> <SIL> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
sure <VOCNOISE> well that and they <SIL> like tuesday <SIL> when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there <VOCNOISE> she came in and i <CUTOFF-di=didn't> i was reading a book <SIL> and i let her out and i let her back in and i started reading again <VOCNOISE> and i'm looking around and here's mud <VOCNOISE> so it's kind of good in a <EXT-way> <SIL> because it kind of well yknow <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> you live here it's not the big of a deal yknow because i know <VOCNOISE> my sister would freak <LAUGH> <SIL> i'm like <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <LAUGH-her_husband_is> believe it or not <SIL> uh they're not really i wouldn't call them neat freaks but <SIL> um <SIL> we tease them because <VOCNOISE> my parents and her <SIL> live within a couple miles of each other in dublin <SIL> <EXT-and> you have to take off your shoes when you go in which is really <SIL> it's amazing how good their carpet looks <IVER>
just from doing that but when you have a dog <SIL> why bother <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and they won't allow dogs <VOCNOISE> so <LAUGH-she's> not allowed to go over there <VOCNOISE> so she's always like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-but> <VOCNOISE> but it does make a big difference so i guess that's what i'm saying for them <IVER>
it'd almost be better if they let the dog go over because yknow she's gonna bring in mud and <EXT-grass> and <VOCNOISE> it's not gonna be perfect maybe knock something over <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> kind of start with her but you have to go home <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean <IVER>
to let her out and that's kind of like i mean of course a kid you can't put in a yard and <IVER>
<LAUGH-leave_them_alone> for hours like i did this morning but <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
<CUTOFF-defi=definitely> <CUTOFF-i=it> <CUTOFF-w=would> it would be nice but no <VOCNOISE> um <LAUGH> <LAUGH-so> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah yeah <SIL> i think so <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah to sit on it <VOCNOISE> she's not allowed on the couch <SIL> but we had caught her last winter <SIL> on the couch <SIL> yknow you come home and it's warm and <VOCNOISE> hey there's a doggy <CUTOFF-b=bone> <SIL> bone up here <EXT-hmmm> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> so we've even been known to slightly start pulling out <SIL> yknow let the garage door go down <VOCNOISE> i'd sneak out of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she's on the couch and she's <SIL> like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> i'm caught <LAUGH> <LAUGH-it's_hilarious> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh we have fun <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
anybody see that
