<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow i i said to myself because i had post partem depression with my third and fourth child <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i thought it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> what good am my going to be to these children if i'm not able to take care of them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> decision was said <SIL> after the fourth child we would practice birth control <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so i and i felt comfortable that <IVER>
no because i think there's the ideal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> everything <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> if you can't live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do <SIL> and uh i think that's where i was coming from <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> even now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean i i could never <SIL> agree with abortion lets say <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i i would stand by the church and and most <SIL> most of the church laws i do stand by <VOCNOISE> but i guess the birth control issue became so personal <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with a <SIL> what i felt was a clear conscience and what i did <SIL> i don't have any regrets for it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what about you <IVER>
i think it has a lot to do with the fact that the <VOCNOISE> that they <SIL> the church <IVER>
yeah <CUTOFF-d=?> <CUTOFF-f=?> <CUTOFF-pro=procreation> <CUTOFF-t=?> procreation part of <SIL> what marriage is all about but i see marriage as <SIL> more than just propagating <IVER>
so that's <SIL> yknow <SIL> <CUTOFF-ba=based> <SIL> a lot of my decisions were based upon that <IVER>
they haven't <NOISE> hum um <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
well and don't you think too the <CUTOFF-psych=psychologically> that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the more they have found out psychologically speaking about <VOCNOISE> children and the placement of children in the family and the <SIL> um <SIL> throes of not having enough or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or being <SIL> <CUTOFF-s=sorely> <SIL> sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both <SIL> know the <CUTOFF-ek=experience> <SIL> that experience from being <VOCNOISE> <SIL> one of eleven children raised so yknow you didn't have the advantages that <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and of course i think too as in america the um <SIL> the <CUTOFF-f=farm> <SIL> farm families yknow they wanted <SIL> that was more laborers for the vineyards so to speak so i think that might have influenced a lot of that <VOCNOISE> but over the years it it um <SIL> it just made sense to me <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in fact it <VOCNOISE> looks like in my family that they're <CUTOFF-t=?> going <SIL> the children are going to be mostly in twos <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow not even going to three or four <SIL> i mean <ERROR-is=it's> <SIL> not over yet but my girls are forty two and <SIL> forty one <VOCNOISE> <SIL> soon to be forty one so um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think that their child bearing years are over <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh <IVER>
i know <IVER>
oh my gosh <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
see there i think there has to be a quality to life too <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <IVER>
hum <IVER>
it's very hard <IVER>
that was your youth <SIL> and that's good i mean <IVER>
that's good to be there <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
