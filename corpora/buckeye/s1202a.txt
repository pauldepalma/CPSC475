<SIL> my mom never had an epidural jason's mom never had an <CUTOFF-ep=epidural> <SIL> yknow and that looks worse to me did you see that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it takes twenty minutes they thread this thing this needle in your back they put this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that sounds worse to me than even <VOCNOISE> having a baby <LAUGH-I_just_can't_I> <CUTOFF-sai=said> <SIL> i don't want anything in my back <LAUGH> <LAUGH-so> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i guess it's true you just have to wait and see once you get there <SIL> what happens <IVER>
see that's great though <IVER>
was it hard <IVER>
really <IVER>
<EXT-oh> <IVER>
hmm <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
uh-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> really see we almost think that that would be better but when you put it like that it <CUTOFF-cer=certainly> certainly <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
yeah that's true that's a pretty good analogy <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
hm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> something to think about <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh the <CUTOFF-v=video> it was the <CUTOFF-vide=video> the <CUTOFF-v=video> the video tapes that i didn't like <VOCNOISE> it wasn't the class that was <CUTOFF-ski=?> the class was kinda goofy <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> it was that and watching the cesareans which i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm not a <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> oh yeah they showed they cut open the they're pulling this baby out of this little hole of this ladies stomach and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> i had a heart surgery when i was younger <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so i've had lots of needles and those types of things and i when it comes to needles <HES-and> and that kinda stuff <VOCNOISE> i'm just kind of squeamish about it <SIL> yknow so that stuff i just <NOISE> <SIL> i just don't want to see it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i mean it's not <SIL> i mean it was a <VOCNOISE> really long time ago <SIL> everything's fine <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i guess <SIL> for me i just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-it> <HES-it> <SIL> i don't know it's just it's just a little more a little more than i wanted to see <VOCNOISE> but the classes i think were helpful <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but um <VOCNOISE> what'd you ask me <IVER>
oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah i think <SIL> i think they'll be very helpful <HES-um> <SIL> i was going to o s u for <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> to deliver the baby so i decided to take the classes there <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and basically <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my mom had reminded me over and over again sarah you need to schedule <CUTOFF-er=your> lamaze classes so i called o s u and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i scheduled them <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah jason and and i and i went together <IVER>
and basically they were three weeks long they were about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> four and a half hours <SIL> the first one was <SIL> really long <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow jason was <VOCNOISE> he's i can't take this <LAUGH> last night wasn't so bad though i mean the first one was a lot of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> lot of <SIL> information classroom kind of stuff but <VOCNOISE> he did real well he was much <HES-uh> he's just a <CUTOFF-sweet=sweetheart?> he's just wonderful he was much more interactive <HES-then> than a lot of the other guys were just kinda <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they would sit there and they weren't breathing and they were kinda rolling their eyes and i just think god you bunch of bums yknow it's gonna come down to it yknow and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and you're gonna be so awful and he's just <SIL> real supportive and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and just <VOCNOISE> he's just terrific <LAUGH-so> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-it_makes_it> does <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it makes it better <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yep <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <LAUGH-you're_doing_fine> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the parenting stuff they gave us a video to watch at home which was things like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> how to diaper your <EXT-baby> <EXT-um> <SIL> a thing about whether you should leave them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> crying in their in their bassinet or crib which of course <SIL> <HES-I> think is horrible and i think it's good that they've come out with all these new studies that tell people don't do that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> lets see what else was there <VOCNOISE> feeding your <CUTOFF-baby=baby> i mean it just <IVER>
that kind of stuff <VOCNOISE> so it was mostly <CUTOFF-th=?> like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what we would do is we would talk about <VOCNOISE> we'd talk about like <EXT-medication> like as far as while you're in labor <IVER>
uh breast feeding <VOCNOISE> there was a lot of that <VOCNOISE> i could tell these poor guys are like uh <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-can_we_not_talk_about_this> yknow they were all kind of uncomfortable <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
and then <VOCNOISE> like lets see <CUTOFF-w=?> <SIL> a lot of it was <HES-I> mean <VOCNOISE> most of it was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was <CUTOFF-y=yknow> like <VOCNOISE> pre <EXT-labor> and then there was the breathing that we did at the end but other than the video <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was mostly like labor related <IVER>
they tie it with <VOCNOISE> it was all very pro breast <CUTOFF-fee=feed> you could tell you could really tell that they had an opinion about this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> we talked about positives and negatives of breast feeding things about <VOCNOISE> um <CUTOFF-he=he> like the immune <CUTOFF-syste=system> some of that stuff i already knew <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they had this thing about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the nurse said that there have been studies done where babies that have been breast fed have higher i q's <IVER>
which <VOCNOISE> i <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she said that and i said <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
are you <EXT-sure> <HES-I> <IVER>
i was <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
and that's the way i felt about it <HES-not> i'm not saying that that's not a possibility but <IVER>
<SIL> for someone to actually state <SIL> in a class <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you breast feed your baby they're gonna have a higher i q than if you don't <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <HES-thought> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum the bonding <IVER>
or <IVER>
breast feeding <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right and i think that yknow i think that it's just because yknow <HES-you> <SIL> do so because i know i've done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way <VOCNOISE> and i think a lot of these people just <VOCNOISE> yknow they <HES-say> <VOCNOISE> the nurse says something you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kinda strange but i mean <VOCNOISE> i think there's a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that it <VOCNOISE> i would want to do it for <VOCNOISE> for a while as long as i could <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
really <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> really <IVER>
really <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
huh <IVER>
that's different <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
hm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
she's okay right <IVER>
<LAUGH-oh_no> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-wow> <IVER>
well sure <IVER>
<LAUGH-sure> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
really <IVER>
huh <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-the=that> we didn't really get <VOCNOISE> the the video tape they gave us was half infomercials <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then <LAUGH> <LAUGH-things_like> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> things like how to clean the umbilical <CUTOFF-chor=chord> i mean <VOCNOISE> stuff like that but you're <CUTOFF-b=?> <CUTOFF-you=you're> <SIL> as far as actual parenting things on it there was really nothing <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
even in the package of information <IVER>
they gave us <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think it would probably <HES-I> i think it would be certainly interesting
