<VOCNOISE> obviously it's not something new that's <SIL> been coming <LAUGH-around> i mean it's obviously been around for a long time <IVER>
and <SIL> i mean <SIL> yeah if they find the cause of it whatever you know that's good but <SIL> at the same time it <NOISE> the cause of it doesn't really matter <VOCNOISE> i mean the fact of matter is it's there they have to deal with it so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
if they <VOCNOISE> had a way to cure it then fine <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> leave that up to the people <IVER>
don't say oh well <VOCNOISE> your son's gonna be gay he's two right now let's <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> change this so it <VOCNOISE> so it doesn't come out to be a problem or whatever <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people <IVER>
i mean obviously <VOCNOISE> if <LAUGH-someone's> <VOCNOISE> like thirty and they're gay i don't <SIL> see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> honestly <SIL> i can't say it really bothers me too much <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i mean as far as <VOCNOISE> just dealing with <VOCNOISE> gay people or whatever <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> doesn't bother me at all <VOCNOISE> it's just something <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna <VOCNOISE> deal with or whatnot <VOCNOISE> um so i mean <VOCNOISE> the fact that <VOCNOISE> i mean two <VOCNOISE> people of the same sex are living together married or whatnot <VOCNOISE> that doesn't bother me <VOCNOISE> like i said it's just more something that <VOCNOISE> i don't know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot <VOCNOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> i think it's just more because it's so <CUTOFF-wei=weird> <VOCNOISE> different than <VOCNOISE> like what you <LAUGH-normally_see_or> things like that <IVER>
but at the same time i mean i don't <LAUGH> dislike them or anything for it i mean <NOISE-it's> <VOCNOISE> it's their choice i mean <SIL> fact of the matter is it doesn't have any <VOCNOISE> effect or <VOCNOISE> anything on my life so <IVER>
i don't know that's kind of a <VOCNOISE> tricky question really <VOCNOISE> because on one hand <SIL> obviously the kid <SIL> definitely <LAUGH-will> get <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> made fun of and teased and things like that <IVER>
during school <VOCNOISE> but at the same time <VOCNOISE> i mean as long as <VOCNOISE> the <LAUGH-parents> love the kids it doesn't really matter what sex they are and they treat them well <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so i mean that's kind of a tough question <VOCNOISE> to answer i mean it's almost <VOCNOISE> it's something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously <SIL> at the age that they'd be adopting um they <VOCNOISE> obviously wouldn't know <VOCNOISE> how to answer that question yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i can see where <VOCNOISE> the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into <VOCNOISE> gay people or whatever <VOCNOISE> um just because obviously <VOCNOISE> you basically mimic your parents as far as <NOISE> what you do when you're young and <VOCNOISE> things like that <SIL> and obviously <LAUGH-if_you_so> <VOCNOISE> had two <VOCNOISE> male parents or whatever <VOCNOISE> obviously you might be thinking <LAUGH> more towards <VOCNOISE> like dating guys and things like that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i don't know if that'd be really a problem though i mean i don't know if that would <VOCNOISE> honestly happen <IVER>
um <SIL> i mean <EXT-fact> of the matter is if being gay is <SIL> a genetic disorder <VOCNOISE> then that should have no effect <SIL> on the kids because <SIL> they should still be <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> normal i guess or <HES-whatever> <VOCNOISE> you want to say <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> as far as <VOCNOISE> being heterosexual <VOCNOISE> so i mean i really can't say that i'd see that affecting the kid's <IVER>
sexuality at all <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
that wouldn't bother me at all <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i can't say that'd <VOCNOISE> really bother me too much i mean it's <LAUGH-the_same> thing as <VOCNOISE> having <VOCNOISE> a woman gym teacher or whatever <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i mean fact of the matter is <SIL> a lot of people out there <VOCNOISE> i guess <VOCNOISE> could be child molesters or whatever i mean it <LAUGH-doesn't_matter> if they're straight or gay or <VOCNOISE> whatever <VOCNOISE> the fact of the matter is i mean they're <SIL> they're out there <IVER>
and anyone you come across could be <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> getting <VOCNOISE> i don't know i guess <VOCNOISE> weird ideas of your kids or whatever <IVER>
i was in the cub scouts <IVER>
so that was like <NOISE> through like sixth or seventh grade or something like that <NOISE-yeah> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i don't think that really matters honestly <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_mean_it's> <VOCNOISE> i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts you're usually <VOCNOISE> eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up <VOCNOISE> and i think by <LAUGH-that> time <SIL> most kids have at least a general idea of who they are <VOCNOISE> and what they <LAUGH-like> and don't like <VOCNOISE> um i can't see <SIL> i can't see them actually looking at like <VOCNOISE> uh their <VOCNOISE> leader or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore <VOCNOISE> um i mean obviously it should be someone that they <NOISE-respect> <VOCNOISE> but i can't say that they'd be like oh well he does it so <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna have to do it too or whatever <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
really <IVER>
i <CUTOFF-d=didn't> <IVER>
didn't hear about that <IVER>
um <SIL> i would agree that i <EXT-think> <VOCNOISE> regardless of your race you should be able to adopt <SIL> a child i mean <VOCNOISE> just <EXT-because> <VOCNOISE> you're a black kid living with like a white family doesn't mean <VOCNOISE> you can't still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of <VOCNOISE> i mean it's the same <LAUGH-thing> with like <SIL> irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it's no different <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can't see it being a problem of any sorts <VOCNOISE> um i mean just as long as they have someone that <SIL> cares for the kid and <VOCNOISE> does stuff for them i mean <SIL> i can't see it being any <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> there weren't a lot but uh there were definitely <SIL> some there at least i mean <IVER>
um <SIL> eh about the same number <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
