<SIL> <VOCNOISE> he was being real helpful <SIL> yknow <SIL> with the <SIL> uh being a support <VOCNOISE> yknow my parents are very supportive but <SIL> yknow it was just sickening that I when I sat down there and they <SIL> just you know the bidding started at a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and <SIL> actually they offered us twelve thousand dollars my <SIL> attorney looked at him and said are you fucking nuts <SIL> he said this guy had his head split open and <SIL> it was your negligence <SIL> so <SIL> you know <SIL> we'll we'll take that as an insult <IVER>
<SIL> and don't insult us any more or we'll go to trial <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so my attorney jumped it back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollar <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I couldn't take sitting there <SIL> these guys going back and forth and what they thought I was worth <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> even the arbitrator was an asshole <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> but uh <SIL> that's the way that system works <IVER>
that's all they understand is money <IVER>
the lawyers the judges everybody <SIL> that works in that system <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I don't care who they are there isn't an honest one in it <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> I don't care <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there isn't an honest one in it they might think they are <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but once you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> expose yourself to corruption <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you take that in with you <IVER>
and sooner or later <SIL> yknow all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service <VOCNOISE> I guarantee you they went in it with <VOCNOISE> the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> once they get in there <SIL> it's such a bureaucracy <IVER>
it's so corrupt <SIL> they have two choices <VOCNOISE> to stay in it and try <VOCNOISE> or to succumb to all the things <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ninety percent of them as you can see what happens in washington <SIL> <VOCNOISE> have succumbed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> there's a <VOCNOISE> I don't I don't hear any of them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> raising hell about what really matters in this country <SIL> <IVER>
yknow they all get uh side lined and side tracked by special private interests and that's <SIL> that's the bottom line <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and it's sad but there's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <CUTOFF-I=I> I choose not to involve myself in that <SIL> as <VOCNOISE> <SIL> much as possible we ended up settling for <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yknow bout seventy thousand dollars and uh <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it was just a hard decision to make yknow because I felt yknow <SIL> a lot more shoulda come from that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I mean in <CUTOFF-or=order> <VOCNOISE> joking around yknow I saw that Adam Sandler movie Big Daddy he <SIL> got his foot run over by a cab and there was a line in there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> pardon me where he says uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well I got my foot run over by a cab and that cab was huge and the jury decided that one night of pain in the hospital was worth two hundred thousand dollars <IVER>
<IVER>
and I'm like yknow what hospital was that yknow where <SIL> <CUTOFF-wh=what> <EXT-what> what <EXT-jury> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> so a lot of the things you hear in movies and television about these multi million dollar lawsuits <HES-are> <SIL> <HES-is> is a lie <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> even the lady that <SIL> I mean <VOCNOISE> sued <CUTOFF-f=for> <SIL> mcdonald's for <VOCNOISE> <SIL> spilling the coffee on herself because she put <EXT-her> in her crotch with the lid off yknow uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh there ought to be a common sense clause in law suits yknow <CUTOFF-i=it> her own stupidity <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and <EXT-then> you get the attorneys trying to argue that well mcdonalds <SIL> coffee is hotter than every other <SIL> coffee <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
it's like <VOCNOISE> big deal <SIL> yknow common sense it's hot you don't put it in a sensitive area while you're driving to work <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but she sued for ten million and the papers said she won ten million <SIL> she didn't <SIL> <SIL> I mean after that ten million award was given by a jury <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then the uh mcdonald's is allowed a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> an appeal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at the end of a year so she doesn't see any money for a year <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and that's if they don't appeal <SIL> but ninety percent of these big corporations have the money behind them they have the lawyers behind them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so they can sue for an appeal <IVER>
uh poor people can't do that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-so> after all is said and done with her case she was left with about a million dollars <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then out of that million the attorney in the firm got a third <SIL> plus she had to pay off his expenses so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> really she was probably left with only about three hundred thousand dollars <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which if used wisely okay maybe she could've <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but it sounded to me like she didn't have a money problem anyway <SIL> she was a corporate person <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um but a very stupid person <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so I mean that's basically my my <SIL> battle with the legal system I <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow I've <CUTOFF-g=got> I've got a person right now that owes me five hundred dollars that I wanted to take to small claims court <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I even got the <ERROR-ca=cancelled> uh the cancelled check to prove it and <EXT-everything> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow uh <SIL> and when I look at what the alternative is which is subjecting myself to <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> unfairness <SIL> uh <SIL> even though I feel I got a concrete no way <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> uh those are the ones that I mean I'd have to pay an attorney and the cheapest one I can find right now is a hundred forty five dollars an hour <IVER>
and <CUTOFF-n=nobody> nobody's worth that <SIL> you know <SIL> so that's what I'm saying it's so retarded <SIL> uh over <CUTOFF-th=the> I don't mean to <SIL> use that word in a bad way but it's ridiculous <UNKNOWN-so_just_but_it_that_I_mean_uh> that's better word <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh that <SIL> that people have to uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can't afford the legal help <SIL> so I think that's wrong <SIL> in this country <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the land of the free and the home of the brave yeah right yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's land of the free all right yeah it's free country but it'll cost you <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> I don't know <SIL> uh <SIL> this freedom <SIL> semi quasi freedom <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's an illusion of freedom and a reality of freedom <NOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and the indian people know the big difference of that <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
so <SIL> but <EXT-that's> yknow <SIL> I ended up settling the attorney got most the money <VOCNOISE> what little I had I invested <EXT-some> and then I made some bad investments when I went off <SIL> my medication <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> blew it <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow so that was my responsibility my fault but uh <SIL> yknow how it was just <EXT-the> years of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> pent up frustration and I just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I spent it <SIL> I spent it in a <SIL> yknow unorthodox way but <SIL> yknow well I had fun doing it <IVER>
uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> won't lie there <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> lot of happy strippers in town <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or I should say exotic dancers <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> well something that <HES-I> I I wanted to get into some kind of counseling <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> with people that had been through traumatic experiences <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but I need to be at a point where <SIL> yknow <SIL> I'm <SIL> in my recovery <SIL> where I know <SIL> I won't be sucked back down into their <SIL> <VOCNOISE> way of thinking <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so it's it's a step by step process I <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> I tried to go into counseling for chemical addictions yknow for alcohol and drugs <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but <SIL> um the bullshit excuses I keep hearing from these addicts was just too much to take <SIL> and even <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> even the bullshit excuses from former addicts <IVER>
it was like uh give them a license to be a screw up <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh a lot of the nurses even who were former addicts yknow when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they weren't doing following protocol <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and of course me I'd be the one saying hey you're not following protocol <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they'd say well yknow I'm a I'm a former addict I'm allowed to do that <IVER>
I said <EXT-no> no you're not <IVER>
yknow <SIL> <IVER>
<EXT-yes> <SIL> yes and <CUTOFF-a=and> and that's so I'm <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I'm geared towards yknow with people with mental illness yknow they've they've diagnosed me with bipolar but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow my neurologist says the bipolar was a just a chemical imbalance as a result of <VOCNOISE> the brain <SIL> injury <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and spiritual leaders told me that uh it's a spiritual imbalance <SIL> <VOCNOISE> there's there's <SIL> really no uh chemical thing there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there's <CUTOFF-th=the> the problem is a <HES-both> physical mental and spiritual with the majority of the problem is spiritual <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when you talk to people that <SIL> uh know that <IVER>
not believe it they know it <IVER>
I mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you talk to people in the catholic church about the unseen <SIL> meaning the spiritual realm <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they freak out <IVER>
yet they pray a prayer every sunday we believe in the seen and the unseen <SIL> <VOCNOISE> I'll never forget it <SIL> because I recited it for god knows how many years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but when you talk to them about possession when you talk to them about demons or spirits <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they freak out <IVER>
or they use the bible to say well yknow god specifically says in this chapter not to partake in spiritual activity <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well who do you think wrote that <SIL> yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> who do you think wants to keep you from <SIL> from doing something that'll help you because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> people this land and <SIL> indigenous tribes all over the world they don't follow the bible <SIL> they've done pretty damn good <SIL> yknow and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <IVER>
it's just the <CUTOFF-spirit=spiritual> <EXT-the> spiritual aspect there is the realm even einstein the most <VOCNOISEd> brilliant man supposedly mathematically of our time <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ah even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yet but nobody has taken the time or made the time <SIL> <VOCNOISE> to challenge his theory <IVER>
yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he says that e equals m c squared I say it's e equals m c cubed because <HES-the> the world is three dimensional <VOCNOISE> it's not two dimensional <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh two dimensional limits <SIL> everything but you look at his theory of relativity <SIL> <VOCNOISE> all of our mathematical theorems <VOCNOISE> physical theorems on physics and things of that nature <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> have been based off that <SIL> <IVER>
and they're not accurate <SIL>
