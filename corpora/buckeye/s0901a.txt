i can't imagine that it <HES-would've> i mean i'm sure brazil would've been <HES-even> <VOCNOISE> more different experience but i think it was <VOCNOISE> more just <SIL> <HES-a> <SIL> a resentment for <SIL> sort of everything about america and what <SIL> what they're fed it was a real love hate relationship <IVER>
yknow it was <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> while they totally embrace the culture and all the stores and everything like that <VOCNOISE> and the food <SIL> it yknow the fast food or whatever <SIL> they hate it at the same time because it's ruining <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-an=and> <SIL> <HES-and> i had a lot of friends from elsewhere in yknow western europe <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> yeah they just were <CUTOFF-kin=kind_of> <SIL> and <HES-I> <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> i was quite surprised actually because when i first went there <VOCNOISE> uh i'd worked on an <HES-island> <SIL> previous <UNKNOWN> <SIL> i mean mackinaw island do you know it <SIL> sort of just <SIL> north of michigan but <VOCNOISE> and i had met some english people there and it was <VOCNOISE> yknow there all the americans were like oh english people your accent is so neat and <VOCNOISE> all that kind of thing and then when i went there <SIL> yknow i <SIL> and this was actually one of my friends but i remember <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then <VOCNOISE> she sort of looked at me and she said like <SIL> oh <SIL> actually i shouldn't be asking you i don't wanna learn the american way to say those like i wanna learn the british way to <SIL> and people would say things all the time and it was <VOCNOISE> yknow they'd ask you what your background was <VOCNOISE> and if you'd say well i'm american they said well yknow like <SIL> where <SIL> your <SIL> ancestors from or whatever <VOCNOISE> and then you would tell them <SIL> and then <SIL> yknow on the same turn they would just sort of like snicker and be like oh you're not <SIL> whatever of this european thing you're <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow sort of <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah yeah like <IVER>
definitely <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and <SIL> and that what they say that we've done to the language and everything else and <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> you're not a typical american <LAUGH-but_yknow> and then the next hour and a half they just say how <VOCNOISE> bad americans are and you kind of think like <VOCNOISE> well thanks for the exclusion but <LAUGH-you_still_have_been_insulting_me_for_an_hour_and_a_half> <IVER>

well it <SIL> obviously i sort of surmounted that because i've been <SIL> yknow i spent a lot of time there since then i think had i <SIL> only studied there for a semester <HES-or> a quarter i would've come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then <SIL> yknow after that yknow you just sort of <VOCNOISE> yeah get to the point where you're just kinda <CUTOFF-l=like> <VOCNOISE> yknow laugh it off and just think oh here we go again and then <IVER>
that's it <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
uh <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> the lifestyle was <SIL> yknow very easy to fit into and i've always been <SIL> yknow <SIL> interested it and <SIL> yknow <SIL> sort of like to the whole like <SIL> european culture <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <SIL> before i went there but <SIL> i think <SIL> the most difficult was <SIL> actually because i was studying english when i went there <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> yknow studying <HES-English> here is <SIL> a dime a dozen and <SIL> studying english in <CUTOFF-amer=america> <SIL> or in <SIL> england <HES-is> <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> sort of <SIL> i don't know uh more uh sort of elitist which i didn't realize before i got there <VOCNOISE> so i was in all these courses i was the only american and the classes were really small <VOCNOISE> and it was <SIL> yknow you <SIL> i definitely got a feeling and a <SIL> it <SIL> there were a few classes that really stood out where <CUTOFF-tha=there> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow there was sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow you'd <SIL> i'd hafta say something or i'd hafta give a presentation or something and it was sort of like oh <SIL> yknow what what does this american know and <VOCNOISE> yknow it was that was the hardest thing is <SIL> the way i was treated by some of my um peers in classes <SIL> i mean not directly they'd never say anything <SIL> terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of <SIL> yknow that feeling of <SIL> uh <IVER>
and what they would say about americans and american culture like <SIL> at <SIL> that discussion group yknow in front of you yknow so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i love columbus actually <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> when i left <SIL> i was <SIL> fed up with columbus <SIL> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> like anything yknow after being away for a while and <SIL> not really <VOCNOISE> yknow being i mean i have <SIL> friends there and everything but <SIL> yknow i missed my friends and i missed <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> really sort of <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> knowing everything in the city because london <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is never gonna be like that for me yknow and it's just a totally different experience and <VOCNOISE> yknow i did miss columbus and i'm kinda glad to be back <SIL> although now i miss london <LAUGH-so> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um <SIL> well maybe not columbus in particular <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i was <SIL> i think i was just a little burnt out because i was doing the two majors and i was <SIL> i had a heavy course load <SIL> every quarter and i had gone to summer school here as well just to get more done and so i'd <VOCNOISE> yknow done seven straight quarters and <SIL> i'm sure that added to it i had a lot of hard classes and <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> i was just tired of <LAUGH-Ohio_State_and_tired_of_being_here_and_yknow> <SIL> red tape and <IVER>
that whole thing <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> in english <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
