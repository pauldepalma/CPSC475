<UNKNOWN> that's goes with the disorder they know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> they know when <VOCNOISE> who's button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and <SIL> yknow where the line is and they <SIL> push you <SIL> always <SIL> that's why teachers <SIL> they uh they drive the teacher up the wall <IVER>
yknow my daughter yknow there was just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i'd call up to the school and <SIL> yknow the principal like <SIL> he's he'd say miss <EXCLUDE-name> yknow i'm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i am her <SIL> last chance <SIL> yknow <SIL> my daughter was going to summer school <SIL> every summer <SIL> and he's like mrs <EXCLUDE-name> yknow <VOCNOISE> she's like <SIL> yknow <SIL> the average student <SIL> uh <SIL> she's the type yknow that she's gonna get <SIL> yknow she's got gonna get through college yknow she's just one of those <SIL> yknow that just moves right along yknow she's not the brightest yknow but <VOCNOISE> she's bright enough and <VOCNOISE> those are your average professional people out working today <SIL> and i was just like well i just want more help for my daughter yknow i just want <VOCNOISE> somebody to <SIL> yknow jerk her down <IVER>
<SIL> but they wouldn't yknow because my daughter was like um <SIL> real bubbly outgoing <SIL> yknow people person <SIL> and she got by with so much <SIL> at school <SIL> and she's yknow worked it's worked out fine with her <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> with both of them actually <SIL> <IVER>

in the meantime yknow <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> you gotta pay the bills <SIL> so <SIL> i yknow i'm not sure what she wants to do <SIL> she's had so many different kinds of jobs part time jobs though <SIL> hum <SIL> yknow <SIL> i'm <SIL> when she was younger like ten years ago she wanted to have her own talk show <IVER>
yeah <SIL> so <IVER>
i don't know she's getting a second child now it's getting a little harder <LAUGH> <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
i do hope that she does she is a good writer <SIL> i do hope that <CUTOFF-s=someday> yknow someday she can <SIL> be able to do that <IVER>
yeah <SIL> she just likes to write stories and she's real creative that way <IVER>
