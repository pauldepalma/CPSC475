<VOCNOISE> um i'm sort of in <SIL> upper clintonville <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> not so much <SIL> um <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> for <VOCNOISE> for fifteen years i lived uh down on <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> which is more <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <CUTOFF-l=lot> a <SIL> <CUTOFF-I'm=I'm> <SIL> lot of artists live there but i'm amazed that my new street <SIL> is full of artists too <IVER>
it's just yknow <SIL> older <LAUGH-artists> <LAUGH-more> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> more established artists <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
so um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <SIL> no <SIL> no <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> lower clintonville <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <UNKNOWN-m> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <SIL> uh <SIL> the the the public <SIL> transit system i mean i know they're doing the best they can but i don't see how we're ever gonna get out of this without light rail <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i'm <LAUGH-really_bummed> <IVER>
that that that the levy didn't pass <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> let's see <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> boy <SIL> i <SIL> i don't know <SIL> i mean we got a great airport with great connections and cheap flights <LAUGH-everywhere> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that's no that's no drawback we're not isolated <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> boy i don't i <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> um and <SIL> <CUTOFF-thi=this> <SIL> this is something i've thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it's very <SIL> <VOCNOISE> conservative <SIL> yknow not real open to new things <VOCNOISE> or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it'd be really competitive <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> i probably wouldn't be <SIL> working as a freelancer today <VOCNOISE> i came to columbus there wasn't <SIL> yknow there wasn't much going on when i came here <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh yknow it's <SIL> oh we've got art <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we're open to that <SIL> yknow <IVER>
yknow there's not a big established gallery system and everything so a lot of things were just available <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> just <SIL> could walk in and show anywhere <SIL> and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and so i yknow i met a lot of people doing that <SIL> and it's <CUTOFF-d=?> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean i'm <CUTOFF-st=still?> mainly friends with <SIL> the same people i met then yknow <CUTOFF-pe=people> <CUTOFF-m=my?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-m=my?> <SIL> artists my age but um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's been <SIL> and there's yknow i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't belong to any formal <SIL> groups in columbus <SIL> but <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> it's a <CUTOFF-r=real> it's a real strong network of people yknow everybody <CUTOFF-n=knows> <SIL> knows <SIL> everybody <IVER>
yknow so it's uh yknow if <CUTOFF-yo=you> if you have a problem if you wanna talk to somebody <VOCNOISE> well if if somebody you know personally doesn't they know somebody <IVER>
who can <CUTOFF-s=?> who can help you with that so <IVER>
um <SIL> i have work in uh p m gallery in the short north <IVER>
and also at the show of hands <SIL> galleries <SIL> and <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah ellen at lane avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean <SIL> i was really lucky <SIL> <LAUGH-to_run> across her <IVER>
um they try to limit the the <CUTOFF-s=?> <IVER>
the <SIL> uh <SIL> i said i didn't belong to any groups and that's not true i belong to ohio designer craftsmen <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> uh they <CUTOFF-tr=try> <SIL> in the in the shops they try to limit it to ohio <SIL> artists but <VOCNOISE> the membership is <SIL> is <SIL> national <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not it's not really closed <SIL> it's just <SIL> sort of focusing on ohio <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-th=think> i think it fills its niche <SIL> yknow i mean i mean wexner has a niche and the and the museum has a niche <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> i think it fills it very well <IVER>
<CUTOFF-we=well> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
