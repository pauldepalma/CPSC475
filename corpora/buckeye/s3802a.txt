<CUTOFF-th=that's> that's <SIL> one of the things we looked when we were <SIL> shopping for homes was we were shopping for schools systems just as much yknow so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and i don't want to buy a house and i don't want to have to move when my kids get older to move into a better school system so <VOCNOISE> because it seems like since we've bought our house the houses are just <SIL> doubling and tripling in value it's <CUTOFF-unbelieve=unbelievable> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> oh i don't know ours is increased quite a lot since we've been there but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we've been there i guess <VOCNOISE> about ten years <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> we live rented in grandview <IVER>
<SIL> before we got <SIL> this was our first house <IVER>
grandview has it's own school system too <SIL> but <IVER>
yeah <SIL> oh no <LAUGH> that's one you stay away from <LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we did a lot of searching when we bought our house <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> it's hard to find what you want in a house <SIL> and get the school system too <VOCNOISE> you get in to arlington you get in to <VOCNOISE> grandview places like this or bexley <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the price range we were in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you were gonna have to dump fifty thousand in to the houses just to <SIL> get them up <SIL> yknow we had a list of what we wanted in a house and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> our house was only <SIL> seventeen years old when we bought it but it had everything we wanted <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fireplace full dry basement yknow two and a half car garage yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older houses <SIL> wet basements garage burned down or yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the lots were packed <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so we live on a golf course and have a creek in the back yard and so it's really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah they don't yeah they play in the creek they don't play golf yet <LAUGH> <IVER>
the <CUTOFF-ol=oldest?> the daughters are already taking golf lessons <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
so i don't know <SIL> she likes it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> oh yeah it's so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and look in your house <SIL> the neighbors right behind you you're staring at them sitting on their deck <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we got all woods and a creek and then the golf course so <SIL> so that's hard to find <SIL> in the city limits because we're inside two seventy still so <IVER>
yep <IVER>
they put them so close these huge homes and then there's ten feet between them and everybody sits in their little backyard with their fence around it and looks at each other <VOCNOISE> yeah yeah yeah i was just there's nothing and i was we looked at some of those and my wife's like there's no way we're buying the yknow you feel like you're in florida or something <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <IVER>
<HES-eh> yeah <SIL> where the trees were mature and they didn't really ruin our development and cut down a lot of the large trees <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> for columbus <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> living here all my life <SIL> i don't like it yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i like the old cow town <LAUGH-yknow they can call it what they want i don't <CUTOFF-ge=get> it was easy to get around you'd never had any traffic you don't <VOCNOISE> sit on the freeway like you do now now it's like you don't wanna go out at four o clock or yknow you just don't wanna get involved in it <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i don't know growth is good but i guess i'm not into as much as they're <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a lot of other people <VOCNOISE> it's good for the economy but <SIL> it's just amazing all the <SIL> every time you turn around they're plopping <VOCNOISE> two four hundred <SIL> home unit <SIL> yknow developments up here and i'm just thinking <VOCNOISE> <SIL> where are these people all coming from yknow you do <SIL> just can't imagine <VOCNOISE> <SIL> where'd these people all move from <LAUGH-yknow> <VOCNOISE> this is getting scary <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah what's the big draw yknow <VOCNOISE> and you know you still see yknow when they opened up a lone star steak near our house they couldn't even do lunch because they didn't have the people <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> right so you know that it's <SIL> the people are just dying for people to work out there <IVER>
yeah <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i not some of them just look like yknow cracker back <SIL> box houses that yknow they put up in a week or <CUTOFF-some=something> it's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> amazing how you can drive by and then in two weeks drive by and there's fifty homes <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because there's a lot of growth in hilliard hilliards that's starting to scare us actually a little bit because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> now they just built another whole high school so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> two whole high schools i think <SIL> they were up to two or <VOCNOISE> <SIL> three thousand senior graduates last year <IVER>
yeah <SIL> yeah that's the worst part there are a lot <SIL> they could really <SIL> double <SIL> they took <SIL> our neighbor is in the sixth grade and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they took a whole elementary school last year and turned it into sixth grade <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> just one school <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> that's how many of those there was <IVER>
um i don't know <SIL> i think they're enjoying and i don't know yknow <IVER>
but it's <SIL> mindboggling that it's because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you're talking two whole high schools two football teams yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just mindboggling all these people you know you graduate with <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know know of hand full of people and don't know anybody else <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's like <SIL> yknow a lot more of a tight knit group <SIL> <VOCNOISE> as a child so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it <IVER>
yeah oh yeah <SIL> yknow people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so <SIL> it's kind of like the small town <SIL> thing <VOCNOISE> which would have goods and bads but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <SIL> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah my parents still live there and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with it's still live in town and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple years ago and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a lot of participation in that <SIL> and so <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> oh i don't know just seemed easier yknow life was <LAUGH-yknow_I_don't_know> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it just wasn't the the drivings the main issue with <CUTOFF-mo=most?> me yknow the freeways we have here weren't built for the amount of people that travel on them now i remember when they built seventy one north <VOCNOISE> i remember when they built seventy east yknow there were <VOCNOISE> no freeways yknow and <SIL> yeah i remember going up three fifteen when they first opened it and it was like no body was on it <SIL> you could just drive on it and it was like an empty road <VOCNOISE> that no body knew about yet and now it's like a parking lot everyday so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> ya it's just a lot of different stuff about it yknow that and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it seems like <SIL> yknow <SIL> activities to go do things everything's more crowded it's yknow my wife thinks this city's the eat out city <SIL> yknow everybody <VOCNOISE> <SIL> if you go anywhere at six thirty <VOCNOISE> <SIL> everybody and their brother is eating <NOISE> out all the time it seems like constantly we live near a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh <SIL> we live near mill run which is an area <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they've just built up in the last few years that just has <SIL> like twenty restaurants in it that <SIL> you drive by any of those at <SIL> five six o clock <VOCNOISE> <SIL> every lots full to the brim i don't care if it's tuesday thursday yknow <SIL> <SIL> so <IVER>
yeah or yeah or yknow <VOCNOISE> it's tough when you know you've got kids that <VOCNOISE> are doing softball soccer yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> all these events and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow like on thursdays when the daughter plays softball my wife leaves the house at eight thirty and she usually <VOCNOISE> <SIL> drives from work to the softball and after that she <SIL> home by nine <SIL> so she's like i can see how you fall into this drive through window business <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no but luckily yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i pick the kids up so that helps a lot i can get them home we can find feed them and i can get them so that's how our life is <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mister mom <IVER>
oh you have to nowadays yknow i don't understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife <VOCNOISE> <SIL> still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that just doesn't happen now now yknow if your wife didn't work you could expect these things but <VOCNOISE> she's doing forty hours a week too so <SIL> it is it's work and it's a full time job <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they start shoot the seven year old just brought here it is the end of the year <VOCNOISE> <SIL> second grade she brings home this project <VOCNOISE> <SIL> gonna have to have a book report use three books of reference yknow she's never done anything like this it was the battle all weekend long yknow getting this <VOCNOISE> <SIL> information out of her yknow she had to pick an animal and do a whole <SIL> report on it she gonna have to stand up in front of the class and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> make a box with a display in it and i was just like this is second grade this seems more like yknow <VOCNOISE> sixth there seems so much more advanced than when we were kids yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i can't believe in second grade we were already writing cursive already <SIL> that's all she writes in now <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe might be learning some of it <SIL> <SIL> yeah <SIL> she's in fractions she's doing fractions she's doing percentages already in second grade <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i thought we were one plus one two <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> you know in second grade it just seems like they're three years ahead <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
i always wished somebody would redo a survey on that and say yknow back in sixty five or whatever <VOCNOISE> what's the difference between what they're teaching them then and what they teach them now <VOCNOISE> is it really that or is it just our imagination just don't remember enough yeah <VOCNOISE> it seems more to me and computers really have helped it <IVER>
because <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction <EXT-games> and letter games and <VOCNOISE> yknow at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff it's not game game it's <VOCNOISE> it has a game theme to it but <NOISE>
