<SIL> because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the problem with guns in my opinion is you don't have to think to use it <VOCNOISE> it takes yknow you don't have to sit there and load it and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> in a split second <SIL> i think we <CUTOFF-w=we?> <SIL> all are capable of shooting somebody <SIL> for whatever reason <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yknow just stupidity or whatnot <SIL> i don't <VOCNOISE> just in a split second <SIL> yknow <SIL> we we might have that once in a life where we can kill somebody that quickly <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and you can't go <SIL> oh <SIL> yknow <IVER>
i didn't mean to do that yeah <IVER>
<IVER>
<LAUGH> well exactly <VOCNOISE> i mean there are split seconds where you just wanna shoot somebody unfortunately <VOCNOISE> anybody that says that <SIL> i i mean i'm <SIL> i don't even like stepping on ants <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but there's those moments where you're like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> yeah so i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah unfortunately <VOCNOISE> well some people have to <SIL> i mean yknow the police <ERROR-offers=officers> and what not they're required to carry a gun <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> almost every kid i know that <CUTOFF-h=has/had> <SIL> has had a <CUTOFF-gu=gun> even if they keep a gun <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <UNKNOWN-'oh <VOCNOISE> hidden here and the bullets hidden over here <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
they find out a way to get to them <SIL> and um <SIL> i dated a guy where <VOCNOISE> we came in on his little brother and he was loading the bullets in the gun <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and he had them <CUTOFF-t=totally> totally separate <SIL> like that <SIL> and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-kids> kids know and they're curious <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i i mean i'm not for guns because i've <SIL> i <SIL> they <CUTOFF-s=scare> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the guns don't scare me the people <UNKNOWN> <LAUGH-scare_me> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> no <VOCNOISE> unless they have them in a safe or something <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-th=they?> <SIL> and <CUTOFF-m=my?> <VOCNOISE> i just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that protection like they said normally you use it against somebody you didn't mean to use it on <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <ERROR-evf=even/if(conflated)?> somebody else comes into your house with a gun let's face it <SIL> are you gonna have the peace of mind to go get it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'd rather just have a bat by my door or something <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
no thank goodness or if i did i <SIL> blanked it out <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=theyORthe?> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> yeah <SIL> but let's face it the people that have the real good guns are the <LAUGH-people_that_shouldn't_have_the_guns> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> meaning crime and whatnot <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> don't have a problem with people having guns <SIL> but <SIL> we don't need <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> sixty guns per person or whatever the ratio is it's something ungodly like that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and they keep making them and <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mean yeah there was a time it was a part of our culture we did need to hunt to eat <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i have friends that bow and arrow hunt <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm not real big into hunting but at least <SIL> they're <SIL> they have to do something besides sit there and <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um plus if they shoot somebody accidentally <SIL> number one it's really hard to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and secondly it probably won't kill them like a gun can <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and you have to use your brain <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i didn't come from a hunting <SIL> background <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> but <SIL> my husband does work for the state highway patrol so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but none of them <SIL> hardly any of them <SIL> hunt <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> and a lot of them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they respect them <SIL> if yknow what i mean they realize they can kill people <SIL> we do get some of the <SIL> yknow <SIL> machismo people that just wanna go out and shoot <SIL> things and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> yeah i don't <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's not the guns that's the problem it's the people <SIL> that are teaching <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> oh exactly i'm planning on just staying in the house if i can <SIL> <VOCNOISE> or whatnot <CUTOFF-ye=yeah> oh yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> i know i mean we're gonna get some water and whatnot because you don't know people might turn things off like you said <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> so <SIL> yeah i think um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> as a whole we've all <VOCNOISE> kind of gone our separate ways <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which is scary <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mean we don't have the same belief system in anything anymore so it's kind of like oh geez <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> definitely <VOCNOISE> definitely <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i haven't personally researched it but i have seen <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i would personally research it if i was president <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um documentaries and whatnot <SIL> and things on twenty twenty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which <SIL> i don't <SIL> <CUTOFF-who=whole> whole heartedly believe just because it's on tv and they say it's so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it's on tv <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> that three strikes and you're out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> has really seemed to work in california <SIL> because most of the people <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that are committing the violent crimes with guns or <SIL> rapes or what not <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> are doing <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> most of the crime <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so once they're locked up <SIL> yeah it costs more money to house them for life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but they're saving so much <SIL> because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets anymore <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so they don't have to catch them <SIL> <SIL> <SIL> they don't have to process them etcetera <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> so i would really like to see that <SIL> and plus i think once that really <SIL> is <SIL> in <SIL> <UNKNOWN-f> <SIL> <UNKNOWN-k> <CUTOFF-wor=works> the works <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and really working and we're really do we're gonna say we're doing instead of like little parents no honey don't do that <VOCNOISE> no honey don't do that <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean because i think that's <SIL> part of our problem too <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
exactly <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i think that would deter people <SIL> um <UNKNOWN-b> you get one strike and you're like uh <SIL> oh <SIL> um maybe i better clean up my act <LAUGH-my <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> sure <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no <SIL> no <SIL> but <SIL> hopefully <VOCNOISE> when they do get the one strike <SIL> somebody <VOCNOISE> i say somebody because <SIL> i <SIL> right now i don't really think we have that in place <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but we would need more of a um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> one strike <SIL> stepping stone <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow and <CUTOFF-I=I> <SIL> <CUTOFF-thi=think> <SIL> let's face it counseling's probably not gonna work <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and somebody in that it would almost take um i <SIL> do personally know people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <VOCNOISE> go into that type of environment here in columbus and actually work <SIL> with the families <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> work with the kids <SIL> and actually are in there <SIL> living there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> showing them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <HES-it's> it's one thing to go help them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and then leave that and go home to your nice house <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't <SIL> <CUTOFF-unfor=unfortunately> <VOCNOISE> i admit it i couldn't do it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> um <SIL> <HES-if> if people really <SIL> did things like that i think there'd be help for them <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because they're actually <SIL> friends <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> or actually people that have <SIL> been in that environment <SIL> and come out <VOCNOISE> <SIL> those type of people i think might be able to reach them <SIL> i won't be able to reach them <SIL> probably <SIL> just because <SIL> <VOCNOISE> what do i know about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE-word_word> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm <VOCNOISE> yeah i agree <SIL> i don't think it'd be a deterrent at all <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> initially <SIL> but <SIL> if we had more things in place and somebody actually <SIL> realized the background <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and tried to get them out of that <SIL> hopefully even if you save half of them it's better than <SIL> than anything <SIL> <IVER>
