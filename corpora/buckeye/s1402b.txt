on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can't really answer that question how they would have voted <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh because i didn't think that mike coleman exactly had charisma either <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
his youth <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and uh and that's really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in nineteen ninety two because <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <SIL> uh uh uh <VOCNOISE> i haven't said it yet but <UNKNOWN> yknow anyone who listening to this tape or you would be able to know i'm a democrat and generally vote democratic although <VOCNOISE> i'll tell you i <SIL> i did vote for <UNKNOWN> <CUTOFF-Gre=Greg> greg lashuka once and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style <VOCNOISE> and he hasn't been bad for the city but <VOCNOISE> um i'm generally a democrat <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and i've only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in ninety two early on that clinton was gonna win just by <VOCNOISE> <SIL> being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend <VOCNOISE> and a waiter came up and um <VOCNOISE> he said something about yknow <VOCNOISE> and i can't remember how we got started on the topic <SIL> yknow just taking my my order for a restaurant but he said something about um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh dole was too old <VOCNOISE> and this was a young guy he was in college <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i knew there was there was a <CUTOFF-s=sort> a <CUTOFF-s=sort> a sort of a shift <VOCNOISE> people wanted someone <VOCNOISE> <SIL> with younger ideas <SIL> and um <VOCNOISE> a new vision they didn't want the world war two vision anymore <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought <VOCNOISE> do they really understand the difference <SIL> in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> issues <SIL> and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clinton <VOCNOISE> so i think for the average voter that does have a <VOCNOISE> a lot of sway <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'm not sure yet <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> at least based on money raised it looks like george w could trample almost anybody <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but george w hasn't gotten out there in the fray yet and given too many answers to <SIL> issues <VOCNOISE> he talks about compassionate conservativism and i don't know what that means <VOCNOISE> yknow i i want answers to specific questions as to what does compassionate conservative mean but <VOCNOISE> i don't think that i'm <SIL> uh <SIL> average in that i don't go for the the the slick image <CUTOFF-j=just> bothers me <VOCNOISE> um he has the potential of <CUTOFF-ch=trampling> of trampling gore i think that gore will be the the nominee no matter what bradley does gore has it sewn up because he's the insider <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> at <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
yeah i <CUTOFF-thi=think> uh i think they're both boring <VOCNOISE> if you look at the the image thing <VOCNOISE> they're both fairly wooden neither one of them seems comfortable in front of a camera <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh it's interesting on <SIL> on bradley <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my boyfriend is is big in sports <SIL> he's he's <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not as liberal as i am he's a little bit on the conservative side <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and he but he would support bradley simply because he was a <CUTOFF-b=basketball> <VOCNOISE> a a former uh basketball player <VOCNOISE> and i'm about ready to say to him at some point in time yknow if he becomes president he's you're gonna hate him because he has all of these big government things and you're against big government <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um so i don't think people always always see that but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um between gore and bradley i don't see much difference quite frankly bradley's the more liberal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> gore i think understands the need to compromise but i think gore will be the <SIL> the candidate i don't think bradley will be able to go past <SIL> all of the work that gore's been doing for eight years as vice president <IVER>
well see that's not proved out by the <SIL> the approval ratings he still has <SIL> higher approval rating than reagan had in his last eighteen months so yknow people still like what he what he's done <VOCNOISE> i think that that <SIL> um that yknow people don't like all the crap that went with him as the <ERROR-pundints=pundits> on tv <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <EXT-they> say that and they're they're still trying to get him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him <VOCNOISE> <SIL> which is what they would have done <EXT-to> elizabeth dole <VOCNOISE> they wouldn't have been able to attack <SIL> on the issues so they'd find other things to get <SIL> get her on so they start bringing out all these women and all that stuff on <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> most people didn't care about it <SIL> they didn't care about it before the election they didn't care about it <SIL> during his campaign they didn't care about it during his presidency <VOCNOISE> it <EXT-was> <SIL> <EXT-some> <SIL> republican right wing <SIL> i don't know what who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow he may have been a <EXT-cad> yknow he may have <SIL> yknow but <VOCNOISE> she was twenty-one it's not like it was someone who couldn't make up her own mind what she wanted to do <VOCNOISE> yknow and he may have been stupid and a cad uh but i don't wanna know about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> on day one when it hit the the news <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i didn't want to know about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and on the end when he was <SIL> yknow not impeached <SIL> i didn't wanna know about it <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and in between i didn't wanna know about it and they just kept <SIL> angering me because there were other things i wanted <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the government to do <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and this congress is the worst i've ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to <VOCNOISE> be on the <EXT-pulse> of of where america is on such issues as gun control and women's rights and and things that are important to people <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> they they've tried to make pseudo issues out of clinton and then they tried to make a pseudo issue out of yknow giving a tax cut <VOCNOISE> people don't want a tax cut when it's going to affect their social security or affect <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh the the the deficit <IVER>
yknow to get a a four or five dollar a <EXT-year> tax cut <IVER>
when they're giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who's making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i don't care if i get five dollars that won't even buy me a tank of gas today <VOCNOISE> keep the money <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and do something good with it <IVER>
so um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> even republicans are like that <IVER>
uh i have a friend in new jersey or two friends <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh a married couple she's a <CUTOFF-de=democrat> a lifelong democrat he's been a lifelong republican <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and there's always interesting discussions when um when i go to visit and i went to visit them <VOCNOISE> few weeks before clinton was formally impeached last year <VOCNOISE> and i just decided i wasn't gonna bring it up <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh and i'd been there three four days and finally at breakfast one morning henry said well you haven't talked about clinton and the impeachment yet and i said henry <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because he's the republican i said <VOCNOISE> i don't even wanna go there <SIL> let i said i don't even think we we wanna get involved in that conversation he says well he says i can understand you saying that but i thought you'd yknow i wanna tell you where i am <SIL> <VOCNOISE> he said when this whole thing started <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i sat down and wrote <SIL> every one of my <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um new jersey representatives <SIL> all of my senators and all of the congress people in new jersey <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and told them that i will never <SIL> ever in my life <SIL> vote republican again <SIL> because of the way this has has played out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean and this was a republican a lifelong republican he says i will <SIL> always now vote democrat because this was just so stupid and such a waste of my my time <VOCNOISE> the country's time <VOCNOISE> the country's money <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh when there are better things to be dealing with and a lot of republicans felt that way you <ERROR-rad=had> to be really extreme right wing <VOCNOISE> to feel other than that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> except here in central ohio <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <SIL> right <IVER>

<VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <IVER>
there generally tends be at least one or two republicans i vote for each <SIL> <ERROR-eat=each> <SIL> each election now sometimes i voted straight democrat because i <EXT-just> yknow i even voted for dorothy teater the first time she ran for county commissioner <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and and i liked what she was saying but then her votes <SIL> <VOCNOISE> later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i <CUTOFF-d=didn't> i didn't vote for her after that <VOCNOISE> but the first time she ran for county commissioner <VOCNOISE> i did it one because she was a woman and i like yknow i i when possible i like to vote for women <SIL>
