<SIL> for people to read i think there's enough other resources out there if somebody's interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> i know <HES-for> for me <VOCNOISE> just because <VOCNOISE> i have so many younger brothers and sisters <EXT-and> <EXT-and> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my <LAUGH-family_and> everything i know how <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i've got <HES-some> some <SIL> <HES-some> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-pret=pretty> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-pret=pretty> what i feel are pretty good opinions about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> how to handle different things and i know that my mom <VOCNOISE> always consults me yknow like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my sister <VOCNOISE> yknow she got her the d in french which vanessa is just <VOCNOISE> she's <VOCNOISE> this girl is almost creepy she's so bright <SIL> i mean she <EXT-really> is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> thing is one of those things were she just doesn't turn in her stuff <SIL> yknow and if <VOCNOISE> she's twelve <IVER>
<EXT-and> <SIL> it <SIL> <EXT-it's> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=yknow> yknow my mom yknow she always <UNKNOWN-tells_people_what_should_we> yknow what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things <VOCNOISE> so i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i think it's kinda neat that i've been involved in a lot of <VOCNOISE> a lot of the other kids <SIL> that way <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know i think you just kinda deal with it when it gets here though <IVER>
but <SIL> yknow i think one of the things that you see people do a lot <HES-that> really bothers me is that whole thing about <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think you <CUTOFF-ha=have> just have to treat children like they're <EXT-just> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it> <VOCNOISE> just you have to respect them and you have to not not talk down to them and and that whole thing about <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow why can't i do this well because i told you so <IVER>
yknow what <LAUGH-kind_of_an_answer> is that <SIL> even if your answer is <VOCNOISE> i don't know why you can't do it it just makes me uncomfortable <VOCNOISE> yknow that's a <EXT-lot> more fair than because i'm the boss of you or something like that and i think if you respect your kids <VOCNOISE> and and just kinda set boundaries with them <VOCNOISE> yknow kinda try to be <VOCNOISE> i don't know that's the way <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> that's the way my family's always been and it always seems to work really well for us <IVER>
no yeah <LAUGH=because_it_changes> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH=okay> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah_really> <LAUGH> <SIL> aw <IVER>

<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> look at her <EXT-she's> so terrific <LAUGH> <LAUGH-watch_her_go> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
if yup we stay here <SIL> <CUTOFF=probab=prabaly> probably <IVER>
mm-hmm <SIL> i went to private schools for <HES-a> long time <IVER>
hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't think that i would have them go to any <LAUGH> i learned things like <VOCNOISE> how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party <VOCNOISE> that kind of stuff <SIL> was a lot more <LAUGH=focused-than> <VOCNOISE> i mean i didn't even i don't think anybody even taught me how to write in cursive other than my parents <VOCNOISE> so i mean it was <VOCNOISE> <HES-it> it was interesting i mean it was a lot more cultural kind of <CUTOFF-s=?> <VOCNOISE> kinds of things you do a lot of <VOCNOISE> things with nature and and that kind of <CUTOFF-s=stuff> <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> was <SIL> the seventies too so i mean you <LAUGH-have_to_look_at_the_time> what we're talking about <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> i've <HES-uh> i feel like <VOCNOISE> i don't see why <HES-I> i wouldn't send them to public schools <IVER>
i mean <HES-I> <HES-uh> obviously that's a long ways off <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <HES-I> <HES-I> i guess i imagine i would be teaching in <LAUGH-public_school_so_hopefully_I_could_try_to_get_them_where_I_was_but> <VOCNOISE> but <HES-I> <SIL> i don't know i mean maybe <VOCNOISE> i don't is that <HES-I> i don't even know if <CUTOFF-t=?> is dublin really better <LAUGH-than> <VOCNOISE> than <VOCNOISE> columbus public or <IVER>
i think they've got more money <VOCNOISE> i don't know if that necessarily makes them a better school <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think a lot of it is <SIL> is is really what <HES-you> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> <HES-what> <HES-uh> <SIL> as far <HES-as> as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it <VOCNOISE> yknow <HES-my> my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and <VOCNOISE> and they took advanced <VOCNOISE> a p classes <HES-and> and they worked real hard and <VOCNOISE> and they've got i think that they have options <IVER>
that you really <EXT-can> get a lot out of it if that's something you want to do <VOCNOISE> and i think as long as you're involved with the school <IVER>
makes and just keep an eye on what's going on <IVER>
then you're really gonna get out of it what you need to <IVER>
