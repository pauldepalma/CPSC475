<VOCNOISE> and we know that the result could be death <VOCNOISE> then <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> and it <VOCNOISE> and it's <VOCNOISE> an <ERROR-agressin=agression> <SIL> an aggression thing one side will be the aggressor one would <VOCNOISE> obviously <VOCNOISE> because you can't have two <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> two aggressive things <VOCNOISE> uh uh <VOCNOISE> naturally one would be aggressive <SIL> and then one would <VOCNOISE> be aggressive in it's response <VOCNOISE> you can't you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> so in like a state of war <SIL> it was like that so <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-m=?> <VOCNOISE> in that context i think <VOCNOISE> but like <SIL> in the same context <VOCNOISE> i feel it'd be wrong for a soldier to kill a civilian because <VOCNOISE> they didn't <VOCNOISE> um they didn't decide to become a combatant <VOCNOISE> so if you're an <VOCNOISE> if you're a combatant and you make that decision <VOCNOISE> or your drafted which <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> that is kind of like making the decision in the sense that you are part of that society that got you drafted <VOCNOISE> so if you choose to be part of that society <VOCNOISE> that <VOCNOISE> i mean that's a little shadier if <VOCNOISE> but still if you're <VOCNOISE> if you both make the <VOCNOISE> the desire to do it then <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> like if i were drafted i think i would fight i'm sure i would fight for the country or <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i don't think i would go <SIL> <EXT-like> you know <VOCNOISE> i just don't feel the need to go <VOCNOISE> on a <LAUGH-rampage_or_anything> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
well i mean <VOCNOISE> to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if <VOCNOISE> you're guilty or innocent <VOCNOISE> there to me there's <ERROR-worth=worse> <CUTOFF-thi=things> worse things <VOCNOISE> i would think than <VOCNOISE> than dying you know <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-y=you> you <VOCNOISE> like i know in israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin <VOCNOISE> he got locked up <SIL> and he's not allowed to see <CUTOFF-e=?> <SIL> uh because uh <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> under jewish law <VOCNOISE> you can't kill <IVER>
for that for <VOCNOISE> for that so <VOCNOISE> he he got locked up and he's not allowed to see another human being <IVER>
like they have this they have like <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> two doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and then he opens <VOCNOISE> and like <VOCNOISE> could you imagine <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> like <IVER>
no sunlight <VOCNOISE> you know <SIL> the and <CUTOFF-i=it> they don't give him they keep it warm <VOCNOISE> and he's not allowed sheets or razors <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> you know other than electric razors so he can't kill himself <VOCNOISE> so you're just stuck <CUTOFF-y=you> there's nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies <VOCNOISE> and that to me would be <VOCNOISE> like that to me is actually like <VOCNOISE> that has to be worse <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-like> <VOCNOISE> just the agony and the <VOCNOISE> and the i think you'd have to go insane like there's only so much you <VOCNOISE-can> <VOCNOISE> i'd ask for board games or something but like he <CUTOFF-ca=can't> <VOCNOISE> doesn't even hear a human voice <VOCNOISE> because <CUTOFF-wah=?> <VOCNOISE> i think it's something like that was written in the scriptures like <VOCNOISE> you're dead to the world for <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-i=is> <SIL> is the worse that you can do and so <VOCNOISE> the world <VOCNOISE> sees him <SIL> you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> so that'd be <EXT-rough> <SIL> that'd be real rough and <VOCNOISE> so obviously he would want to um <VOCNOISE> i would like they say like now like people that observe him he's like sings to himself and he <VOCNOISE> reads the bible like <SIL> everyday <VOCNOISE-and> <VOCNOISE> but like i don't know that'd be <EXT-strange> <VOCNOISE> be such a horrible thing to go through i couldn't imagine being locked in a room for <VOCNOISE-like> <VOCNOISE> few days <IVER>
like that <SIL> like solitary <VOCNOISE> but like unlimited solitary that <VOCNOISE-doesn't> seem right either but <IVER>
yeah like it's just <UNKNOWN> it's killing it's own citizens it's so <VOCNOISE-ridiculous> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah exactly <IVER>
if you just look at the nature of what they're doing it's just <IVER>
inherently wrong to me <IVER>
yeah exactly that'll <LAUGH-solve_the-problem> <IVER>
that's just it's ridiculous <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
you can get in huge arguments people like no you're lying because if your mother died or someone close to you died you would want them dead <VOCNOISE> and honestly <VOCNOISE> i can honestly say i would not want that to happen to them <IVER>
you know <IVER>
people can't <CUTOFF-understa=understand> <IVER>
they can't fathom that <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> they cannot understand where you're coming from <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah not not for special conditions <LAUGH-nothing> just universally it's wrong <IVER>
yeah that's what it is <VOCNOISE> it's a marketing thing <IVER>
maybe at the <VOCNOISE> under lying base <IVER>
<LAUGH> exactly <LAUGH> <IVER>
that's ridiculous it's like barbarism to me like <VOCNOISE> ugh <IVER>
yeah and we're <LAUGH-one_of_them> <LAUGH> texas is supporting strong they have like <IVER>
i forget they have the <VOCNOISE> like way more than like they dwarf any other state i think so <VOCNOISE> that to me is not <SIL> that's not admirable and then i <CUTOFF-wou=would> <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> so the <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-that's> one reason i wouldn't vote for bush <IVER>
<LAUGH> plus i don't really feel like the <VOCNOISE-republican_party_represents> <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE-populace> at a whole like at their <LAUGH-last> political convention like <VOCNOISE> in uh <VOCNOISE> the last presidential election in ninety six <VOCNOISE> they said one in ten of the delegates that were <SIL> attending the convention were millionaires <VOCNOISE> now granted i know more than ten people and not <CUTOFF-w=one> <VOCNOISE> you know what i <NOISE-mean> <NOISE> <NOISE-so_to_me_I> <NOISE> just feel <VOCNOISE-like> <NOISE> that's not a good representation <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
they <VOCNOISE> they definitely struggle <SIL> it <SIL> they do some <VOCNOISE> i i think <VOCNOISE> to be that high up <VOCNOISE> obviously <VOCNOISE> you're gonna come in contact with powerful <VOCNOISE-people_rich> people and <VOCNOISE> things like that but <VOCNOISE> i think at least even if the democrats <VOCNOISE> do have that same <VOCNOISE> thing they seem to keep more in mind <VOCNOISE-the> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i don't think they represent <VOCNOISE> working class <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> guy either but <VOCNOISE> at least more so than the <VOCNOISE-republicans> <VOCNOISE> so like i said best out of a bad bunch i'd probably <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_think> so <VOCNOISE> i think so <VOCNOISE> and like <VOCNOISE> they just <CUTOFF-d=don't?> neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity <VOCNOISE> me you know <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i have no idea i remember where i was too when the columbine shooting because like <VOCNOISE> my friends and i we're sitting around drinking a few <VOCNOISE-beers> and <VOCNOISE> you know we're channel surfing <VOCNOISE> and you know we see that kid fall out of the window and we're like oh my god what is going on so <SIL> we just left it on and <VOCNOISE> it was quite <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-eyz=?> like it was disturbing because <SIL> i <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> like i was recently out of high school myself and like sure there were fights and stuff <LAUGH-but_it_was_always> like you could avoid them or <VOCNOISE> know what i mean <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> but now it seems like people are just <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> i don't know why that's a trend i mean <VOCNOISE> my dad said <VOCNOISE> uh he grew up in the bronx <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> he said even in the when he was in high school that they had <SIL> they had police officers there so that's not like a new thing <VOCNOISE> but he said <VOCNOISE> you'd have people with like knives and you'd have people with fist fights but you <SIL> like guns was unheard of <SIL> you know and i think <VOCNOISE> i don't know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh <VOCNOISE> they're <VOCNOISE> people feel dejected <VOCNOISE> in high school i'm sure of it <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> i don't i <CUTOFF-was=wasn't> i didn't feel that way <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> i'd like <VOCNOISE> in retrospect i look back and i thought <SIL> you know i'm thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like <VOCNOISE> if every day was like <EXT-so> traumatizing to them <VOCNOISE> like that'd be so like for four years every day you're just like <EXT-teased> or <SIL> something like horrible and you <VOCNOISE> like no one talks to you <VOCNOISE> i'm not <VOCNOISE> justifying what they do at all <VOCNOISE> but i'm saying <VOCNOISE> that would make them more <SIL> that would probably in their mind give them the reason <IVER>
to say you know what i'm sick of this i'm gonna shoot those <VOCNOISE-people> <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i <IVER>
yeah i mean getting a gun doesn't <CUTOFF-se=seem> i mean i was surprised like <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> i would i've never owned a gun <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE-I'm> <VOCNOISE> i think it's pretty easy to get one <LAUGH-actually> <IVER>
yeah so <VOCNOISE> yeah and a lot people turn eighteen when they're in high school so <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-I'm> sure they can <VOCNOISE> go get one there <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's just ridiculous too <LAUGH-though> <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> yeah that's to me that's really weird <VOCNOISE> i don't like i said i don't know what they're <CUTOFF-thi=thinking> <SIL> <CUTOFF-th=the> what they're thinking <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE-or_what> their thought process was but <VOCNOISE> i'm thinking maybe <VOCNOISE> it the social because a lot <VOCNOISE> to me a high school is real social <IVER>
and like the social aspects of it were <VOCNOISE-the> problem <NOISE> so <IVER>
like i know uh like i was a <VOCNOISE> four year member of student council and like did that <CUTOFF-di=did> went that route in high school <VOCNOISE> and i know we always tried to involve other people <VOCNOISE> but like they would look at us and be like that's so lame i would never do it <IVER>
so like <VOCNOISE> it's like <VOCNOISE> you had these warring like <VOCNOISE> two different camps the <VOCNOISE> you know the camp that gets enthusiastic and <VOCNOISE> and that's where i was and then there's the other camp and i'm sure they have <VOCNOISE> their own <SIL> hierarchy their whole structure and like <VOCNOISE> you know they do things their way <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
while <CUTOFF-say=saying> while pooh-poohing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-as> <VOCNOISE> as far as bringing the two together like <VOCNOISE> socially <SIL> i think that's just a rough age <IVER>
you know because <CUTOFF-yi=you> <VOCNOISE> you're learning more about yourself <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> you're <CUTOFF-al=also> you're also learning more about <VOCNOISE> like you're <VOCNOISE-experiencing> a lot of freedoms that you didn't have obviously <SIL> you know <VOCNOISE> you're driving <VOCNOISE>
