<VOCNOISE> her and her mother went and seen it and everything we were <VOCNOISE> divorced at the time and uh <VOCNOISE> then i went and bought the movie <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
and brought her over to my house on the weekend and everything and <VOCNOISE> showed her the movie and <VOCNOISE> i said this is e t we're going to watch <VOCNOISE> e t she goes all right you know we was eating pizza you know and <VOCNOISE> and put it on and then when he <EXT-dies> <VOCNOISE> she starts bawling and everything and i'm going <VOCNOISE> well what's the matter and she goes <VOCNOISE> well he's going to die i said no he ain't you've seen the movie <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but you know it wasn't <SIL> to her <VOCNOISE> the way i <VOCNOISE> took it was that you know <SIL> it wasn't the same it <SIL> it was just wasn't the same movie so <IVER>
and in this one he could die so <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <LAUGH> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
no there's a lot of people go to church that aren't worth anything too you know so i don't really believe that <CUTOFF-per=person> <VOCNOISE> going to church you know uh <VOCNOISE> uh <CUTOFF-r=?> <SIL> makes you a better human being than another human being <VOCNOISE> i believe that the you know your <VOCNOISE> i believe that most people with basic <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> structure in their life if it's <VOCNOISE> based similar to the bible <VOCNOISE> or you could say buddhism or whatever you know uh <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> that you'll tend to have a better <VOCNOISE-life> than you will if you <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-practice> <VOCNOISE> non <VOCNOISE> quote unquote religious <CUTOFF-w=ways> <VOCNOISE> religious ways <VOCNOISE> but i don't believe somebody going to church makes them a better human being than the next person <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-because_there's> a lot of <VOCNOISE> hypocrites that go to church <VOCNOISE> now these kids i <VOCNOISE> i think more just more than anything else i mean <VOCNOISE> one thing i <CUTOFF-r=remember> <VOCNOISE> i remember hearing it a lot about too was they <CUTOFF-we=were> they were picked on <IVER>
i mean <LAUGH> come <LAUGH-on> <VOCNOISE> who wasn't picked on you know <IVER>
i mean just because you're i mean i wasn't really a <VOCNOISE> an athletic i did <CUTOFF-s=sports> play uh <SIL> sports when i was in in high school but i <CUTOFF-wa=was> <VOCNOISE> damn sure wasn't any good you know <UNKNOWN> like <VOCNOISE> other guys but <VOCNOISE> whether i did or whether i didn't you know i <VOCNOISE> i don't <VOCNOISE> i don't <VOCNOISE> nobody picked on me <UNKNOWN> i mean one time i got into it <ERROR-wha=with> <VOCNOISE> with one of the uh <VOCNOISE> centers in football you know big old guy <VOCNOISE> and then uh <VOCNOISE> and i <VOCNOISE-was> still about the same size but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh he said he's going to <VOCNOISE> kick my you know what and everything i said well be outside you know <IVER>
no he <VOCNOISE> he didn't even come <ERROR-ba=bye> i mean he came out but <VOCNOISE> it's like he went the other way i thought well you know he <VOCNOISE> you take it if he'd <VOCNOISE> get a big kick out of kicking my skinny little butt you know then <IVER>
but you know <VOCNOISE> and years ago it was kind of funny we'd seen him uh seen each other and everything and uh <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> at the <VOCNOISE> someplace around and he sit there and went <VOCNOISE> hey remember that time i said yeah yeah yeah <IVER>
he says i didn't <IVER>
he said i didn't think you'd stand up to me i said well you know what the heck <VOCNOISE> you know <IVER>
<UNKNOWN> only thing you could do is <VOCNOISE> beat my rear end you know so <IVER>
i think there's a heck of a lot more to it then what we'll probably ever know um <VOCNOISE> you know <CUTOFF-tho=those> they really haven't checked into the background of the parents you know they're still <CUTOFF-b=?> <VOCNOISE> what their beliefs were and everything <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> and i think that's a shame because you know you mentioned it <VOCNOISE-before> about <VOCNOISE> something accidentally <ERROR-happingening=happening> <VOCNOISE> where uh <VOCNOISE> some kid shoots another kid you know and then the parents are <VOCNOISE> are responsible <VOCNOISE-for> it and everything you know these two kids <VOCNOISE-deliberately> went in <VOCNOISE> to kill <VOCNOISE> and they wanted to kill more than what they killed <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> then they killed <EXT-themselves> so we'll never know <VOCNOISE-from> their endpoint why they did it <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i think there's got to be something <VOCNOISE> that we could <VOCNOISE-find> out <VOCNOISE-from> you know uh <VOCNOISE> from their parents as to how they lived you know they could have been <VOCNOISE> anything you know <VOCNOISE> they could have been down there they could have been <VOCNOISE> making him making him do it you know <IVER>
uh uh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i just think it's a different time now i don't think i think everybody's <VOCNOISE> living more <VOCNOISE-for> today <VOCNOISE> and talking about the future you know <VOCNOISE> hoping that the future's <EXT-there> <VOCNOISE> i think there's a <VOCNOISE> quote unquote uh <SIL> in time aspect to life you know <IVER>
everybody's living longer everybody's uh there's more medical things where people get uh <VOCNOISE> can <CUTOFF-g=get> be healed <VOCNOISE-from> things that they couldn't be healed <VOCNOISE-from> uh <VOCNOISE> so everybody today is living <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> basically as today as their <VOCNOISE-future> where back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean <VOCNOISE> i wasn't really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about <VOCNOISE> tomorrow <IVER>
<NOISE> getting married having kids you know and having a <VOCNOISE> nice place to live <IVER>
<NOISE> um hum <IVER>
yeah and then you know then <SIL> i'll show that son of a gun you know i'll <VOCNOISE> i'll shoot him you know <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> like you know the guys that were <VOCNOISE-supposedly> picking on him i don't even know whether they even shot him then but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but yeah i think they kind of just thought you know <CUTOFF-I=I'll> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'll <VOCNOISE> you know i'll <VOCNOISE> i'll <VOCNOISE-prove> to them that <NOISE> you know they can't push me around <IVER>
and <ERROR-unfortunanley=unfortunately> uh they didn't really <VOCNOISE-prove> anything except for that they that <VOCNOISE> death is <VOCNOISE-final> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
she graduated last year <VOCNOISE> so uh <NOISE> but <VOCNOISE> she went to <VOCNOISE> she went <CUTOFF-ho=home> she was on home study <NOISE> so <NOISE> <CUTOFF-sh=she> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
no she did uh she <CUTOFF-d=?> <VOCNOISE> my ex wife did uh <VOCNOISE> i would've <VOCNOISE-preferred> her <UNKNOWN> to get continue going to school but <VOCNOISE> she had some problems with some students and stuff <NOISE-and> <NOISE> <IVER>
um <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> she just went there last year <IVER>
<VOCNOISE-hum_um> she had a uh <SIL> she <VOCNOISE-was> taught a <CUTOFF-tu=tutor> by a tutor <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> from <VOCNOISE> she <VOCNOISE-was> from kirkisville that's <VOCNOISE-before> she graduated <SIL> which is a suburb of saint louis <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um generally it's in the summertime uh <VOCNOISE> that's the way it was when she was going to school <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> now you know with her going to school at like at like at uh saint louis <VOCNOISE> um <NOISE> i guess it would be that way <IVER>
but we really ever <CUTOFF-ha=havn't> <VOCNOISE> really haven't talked about that but my ex wife's got family here <VOCNOISE> so uh <VOCNOISE> you know she comes in about two or three <VOCNOISE> weeks at least out of a summer <IVER>
and i tend to see her then <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> i uh <VOCNOISE> i think she really kind of knows that from conversations uh with me and <VOCNOISE-stuff> while she was growing <NOISE-up> <NOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> you know mine uh my values and stuff <VOCNOISE> basically are uh more religious oriented <VOCNOISE> you know <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> than i would say <SIL> my wife's <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> so i think she kinda she knows <VOCNOISE> what i value as being important what i value as <VOCNOISE> being not important and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> but <NOISE> on it the rest of the question <CUTOFF-ih=?> i'd <VOCNOISE> i'd love to have been able to have uh <VOCNOISE> uh been <CUTOFF-ykno=yknow?> <VOCNOISE> every other weekend sounds good you know as far as a <IVER>
um <IVER>
i would say see in mine i don't think they really were because i can't really say for anybody else's uh but <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> we would <VOCNOISE> we had <CUTOFF-tende=tended> <VOCNOISE> we had intended on having a uh <SIL> we got divorced in eighty eight and we had intended but then the next couple three years of having joint custody <VOCNOISE> but then <VOCNOISE> our divorce was <VOCNOISE> somewhat bitter <VOCNOISE> or became even more bitter and everything you know <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> that tended not to <VOCNOISE> not to happen <VOCNOISE> and then she ended up getting transferred to <VOCNOISE> to saint louis from here <NOISE> so <VOCNOISE> it <ERROR-wath=was> something that <ERROR-rea=really> really <CUTOFF-wah=wouldn't> <VOCNOISE> wouldn't have wouldn't have been able to <SIL> happen when she moved out there and that was in ninety so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um hum <IVER>
