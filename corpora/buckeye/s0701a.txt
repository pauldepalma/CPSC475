<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> excuse me <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> i'm guessing <IVER>
is it <IVER>
right <IVER>
sounds good <IVER>
oh i yeah exactly <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i was just wondering how could i get a job doing what you're doing <NOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-g=grew> <SIL> grew up in masillon ohio i'm the oldest of five children i have four children my own <SIL> i'm uh <VOCNOISE> i was <SIL> <previ=previously> i was married many years ago <VOCNOISE> and then i've been married to my husband now for twenty one years <VOCNOISE> and we have um <SIL> three children together so i have a daughter <EXCLUDE-at> twenty eight <VOCNOISE> daughter at <SIL> nineteen who's a sophomore at ohio wesleyan my older daughter's a graduate from ohio <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm a graduate of <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> i have a son who's uh <CUTOFF-nin=nineteen> uh <EXCLUDE-let's> see joe is <SIL> he <SIL> fifteen he's a sophomore at <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> high school and i have an <SIL> eighth grade daughter <VOCNOISE> at <EXCLUDE-name> <VOCNOISE> and um i'm a homemaker i have a degree in sociology <VOCNOISE> i've been at home since my <VOCNOISE> a second daughter was born <SIL> with my second marriage <VOCNOISE> and i consider it a luxury and a privilege and i just absolutely love <SIL> being at home i do a lot of volunteer work <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i'm real involved with the school system <SIL> <CUTOFF-C=Columbus?> with columbus public and uh <SIL> i like <SIL> organizing big projects for them um <SIL> my husband's director of engineering for liebert <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so that's why i know what you're thinking yeah and whenever i complain about the weather in columbus he always says we'll go anywhere you want <VOCNOISE> where would you like to live <VOCNOISE> well i wanna stay here i don't wanna go anywhere yet til all my kids are ready <SIL> and then my daughters always say <VOCNOISE> okay mom as soon as we're all done with school <SIL> <VOCNOISE> then we can all move to california but we have to go as a group because i'm real real close to to my children <IVER>
yeah really close <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i'm sure it makes it <SIL> easier <VOCNOISE> but i think that a person can establish a relationship <SIL> <HES-ey> you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working <VOCNOISE> yknow with my oldest daughter <VOCNOISE> i worked but i arranged my life around her so that <SIL> even though i had that degree i waited tables because when she was <SIL> little before she started school <VOCNOISE> i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at seven thirty so i had her <SIL> was with her all day <VOCNOISE> then when she started school i switched over to lunches <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> so i've always arranged my life around my children <SIL> so i have an opportunity to be with them <IVER>
they get <SIL> better and better and better <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i <CUTOFF-he=hear?> <IVER>
i'm i'm really lucky um <VOCNOISE> yknow everyone's always <SIL> crabbing about their horrible kids and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my kids are phenomenal <HES-a> we have this arrangement <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i do <SIL> everything i possibly can to make them happy <IVER>
and they do <SIL> everything they possibly can to make me happy <VOCNOISE> and it's like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> my my oldest girl she <CUTOFF-sh=she> <SIL> we're expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she and i see each other all the time my daughter who goes to <EXCLUDE-name> chose to live at home because she just said it was <SIL> just a better situation for her <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and um <SIL> it's not that these girls aren't independent and can't do it on their <CUTOFF-ow=own> <SIL> they're <SIL> megan could my second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was <VOCNOISE> twelve <SIL> i mean she's just a very very mature very driven <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the only problem she has she didn't have a job to support herself other than that she could have taken care of herself <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> <CUTOFF-sh-she> she chooses to <SIL> still at home and be a part of our life and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my son he's <SIL> both those kids have four points i mean they really work hard in school because they know it's important and my son was uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he was the only <CUTOFF-ti=time?> only one that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in seventh and eighth grade <SIL> he <SIL> took <SIL> that time to do the maturing that most of his friends are doing at sixteen and so i'm really lucky <VOCNOISE> that we had our <VOCNOISE> difficulty at that point <SIL> and uh <SIL> and it was minimal <SIL> but to me having been used to everything being perfect yknow <EXCLUDE-it> was like <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it was like for him to have <SIL> um <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> for him to not make the honor roll every time i couldn't even imagine what was happening with him <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and now he's completely back on track and doing really well <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and my eighth grade daughter is um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my kids are involved in all kinds of different things she's real involved with theater <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um she's <VOCNOISE> yeah everything that comes along yknow she wins the science fair she <ERROR-get=get> does the power of the pen <VOCNOISE> <SIL> she <CUTOFF-k=?> is on student <CUTOFF-coun=council> they all have lots of <VOCNOISE> different kinds of things that they're involved in <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that i'm incredibly proud of them because they're just <SIL> they're <SIL> and they're really <VOCNOISE> they're not geeky and goofy <SIL> they're really neat <IVER>
neat kids that kids like <IVER>
so <IVER>
they're <CUTOFF-v=?> they are they're wonderful everybody always says to me rachel i just don't know what you're doing will you come and take care of mine for me <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and it's <SIL> it's the fact that i have a tremendous respect for my kids i mean i really value their opinions <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i treat them everybody says your mom's weird she talks to us strange it's because i talk to them like i talk to you <VOCNOISE> <SIL> at at whatever age they are <SIL> yknow i don't <SIL> yeah i don't talk down to kids i <SIL> <IVER>
sure <IVER>
sure <IVER>
yeah over the years <SIL> we've had <SIL> situations like that <SIL> yknow a pregnancy here and there and things that people needed to get worked out or someone being worried about <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i uh i <SIL> a <SIL> neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do with it and about it <SIL> so yeah but yknow i <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <HES-it's> it's <SIL> i'm just lucky i'm so lucky <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh i'm <CUTOFF-sh=sure> <SIL> i'm sure of the fact that my parents um <VOCNOISE> my mother tried <CUTOFF-real=really> tries really hard but my <VOCNOISE> <SIL> my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so that he insisted yknow he <CUTOFF-c=could> <SIL> he could <ERROR-t=drink> drink on the weekends and never miss <SIL> work etcetera <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah there was no problem <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> but the biggest problem is the fact that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> he and i <VOCNOISE> i um <SIL> i i <CUTOFF-exp=expected> i've always expected to have some sort of a respect from them <SIL> and because <VOCNOISE> they always wanted me to grow up and be <SIL> independent and think for myself and so i'm exactly what they always said they wanted <VOCNOISE> <SIL> it's just that they can't <SIL> handle that <SIL> and so <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> in a lot of trouble about um the racial thing <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because uh i'm from a school where i was mostly <SIL> white students were <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> almost the minority it was a pretty even it's a very it's a low income neighborhood <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and when i in seventh grade i remember going home and saying was everybody the same and being told well of course they are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i went to school and told everybody i was in love with danny flowers who happened to be black <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i got called into the office and they called in a social worker and they <SIL> i was punished i wasn't allowed to <SIL> uh i was grounded for the year <VOCNOISE> and they never called this kid in i <VOCNOISE> i then i thought this whole thing is so screwed up <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-wha=what's> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> what's wrong with these people <VOCNOISE> they kept saying that they wanted to save this <ERROR-nithe=nice> white girl because i had so much potential and uh they weren't going to let me throw my life away like this so i was <SIL> yknow it's bizarre <VOCNOISE> and so i was always from that time on i decided these these people are all crazy <VOCNOISE> i'm never gonna i'm never gonna be like that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and so i have a whole lot of different values from my <SIL> family <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <SIL> it's <SIL> real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger <VOCNOISE> <SIL> are willing to
