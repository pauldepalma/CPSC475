<VOCNOISE> and you register them <SIL> and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign <SIL> uh in ohio i think it's easier to do that because there is a law that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't think it's in primaries <VOCNOISE> but in general elections at eleven o'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the afternoon <VOCNOISE> they hafta list those who have voted they hafta put up a list of uh <SIL> registered voters and cross out those who have voted <SIL> so what i useta do is i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support <SIL> or <CUTOFF-wer=were> was undecided on the election <SIL> and i would cross off those that had voted <SIL> and then i had a list of those that hadn't <SIL> and i had people waiting at a phone bank <SIL> and i'd call them at work or at home and and i'd offer to take them to the polls <SIL> if you don't have a ride <SIL> uh we will take you to the polls <SIL> if you're worried about yknow someone watching your kids we have certified teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babysit for you while you go to vote <VOCNOISE> because i've also read studies that say people who are routed from their home or their office <SIL> yknow and are reminded to go vote <SIL> will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that <VOCNOISE> because what i did was is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say <SIL> hi this is roberta i'm calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote <SIL> and oh by the way <SIL> oh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levy and <SIL> and if you need a ride let me know we've got them set up for you <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> but yknow that's very <SIL> i mean <CUTOFF-eh=and> and and that's not getting people to vote <SIL> and encourage them to vote because they should that's a a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate <SIL> i don't know how you get people to vote <SIL> i don't know why they don't think it's important maybe because <SIL> we've had it too easy my <ERROR-go=godfather?> <SIL> my grandfather didn't <SIL> my grandfather didn't i mean there was a king and queen and yknow he had no right to vote <SIL> so that when he came here and he could <SIL> that was the most important thing in the world to him <SIL> yknow and that that he just passed it on to <SIL> yknow his daughter my mother <SIL> my father i don't know how he <SIL> it was important to him but it was always important to him and we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes <SIL> we talked about <SIL> issues and he said yknow it was important to to be heard <SIL> so i don't know if it was that <SIL> it got passed on parent wise or what it was <SIL> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
there's no issue <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> not specifically no <SIL> uh sometimes um little groups <SIL> of <VOCNOISE> sometimes you <CUTOFF-wou=would> <CUTOFF-i=if> if there was a college in a community when i was running a school levy campaign <SIL> um we would try to get them either registered <SIL> and and active in a campaign <SIL> um <SIL> but it was very difficult <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=it's> it's sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park <SIL> active in voting <SIL> yknow there are certain little blocks of people <SIL> uh and on school levies the people who voted no which were senior citizens <SIL> i mean they they went to the polls in droves you didn't hafta yknow the the the <CUTOFF-h=hope> <SIL> the hope there was that they wouldn't go to vote <LAUGH> <SIL> on the school levy <VOCNOISE> uh but actually trying to get college kids involved <SIL> i haven't really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself <SIL> it might be a little pocket of a campaign but <SIL> nothing big <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
if if you didn't own let's say on a school levy and you didn't uh you <SIL> you pay taxes i always get because i rent and i always get very upset and i'm very angry when people say <SIL> well you don't hafta pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes <SIL> my rent goes up <SIL> it's built into the rent <SIL> uh at least it's <VOCNOISE> it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord <LAUGH> <SIL> uh and i don't i've never lived any place where my rent didn't go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct f proportion and beyond <CUTOFF-j=just?> yknow uh of what the levy was <VOCNOISE> uh so that would be the first thing i'd say <SIL> and then i'd also say that yknow <VOCNOISE> uh because uh a <CUTOFF-l=lot> a <CUTOFF-l=lot> a number of reasons that people don't vote for school levies now is because they don't have kids <SIL> in the schools <SIL> yknow but education is the foundation of a democracy <SIL> and if you don't have an educated citizenry <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-y=your> your <CUTOFF-v=voters?> <SIL> democracy could go down the drain <SIL> um that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or yknow the the university of virginia and believed in education yknow because he said without an educated citizenry you won't understand the issues <SIL> yknow but it's very difficult today <SIL> to get to people <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i've talked to some <SIL> i've <VOCNOISE> <SIL> almost college age students and they don't see the relationship you can <VOCNOISE> talk logic to them all you want and it's not like the logic gets to them <SIL> and you can talk history all you want and it doesn't mean anything to them and i don't know why <SIL> i wish i did but i don't know why <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i think the latter i don't think it'll make any difference <VOCNOISE> the kids that i know <SIL> in uh junior high and in in yknow college <SIL> uh it just doesn't make any difference to them and they don't like those classes they think they're boring they think it has no relevance to their life <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <NOISE> <SIL> it <SIL> it might and yknow good teachers do that i i <CUTOFF-us=used i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity based teaching <SIL> um <SIL> and i was doing some volunteer work at dublin schools it was supposed be one of the better schools in the area <SIL> and i thought there'd be all sorts of creative things going on and there wasn't it was still read the chapter write the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought <SIL> how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things <SIL> um <SIL> i'm not sure there's so much <SIL> influence from the media <SIL> uh and i say media broad based so you'd be it print media or tv <SIL> um that has this culture today of um <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> stars and yknow media of of <VOCNOISE> phenomenons and <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> they don't see the relevance and i don't think they hear from their parents like i did <VOCNOISE> the importance of voting and that's where it comes from their parents don't vote <SIL> so if their parents don't vote they aren't <SIL> uh again i don't know what the the answer is <SIL> um but it's very scary what's gonna happen in the next couple of generations <VOCNOISE> the only <SIL> <VOCNOISE> good thought for me is i think about this <SIL> is that i won't be here to see the disintegration of the democracy although i have great faith too <SIL> i have great faith in democracy <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if there were an issue <SIL> i think kids would <CUTOFF-ge=get> if if there were <SIL> kids in college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people didn't think was important <SIL> or had no real relevance to their lives <SIL> i mean <UNKNOWN-do> <SIL> i think the kids would <VOCNOISE> would rally immediately <SIL> and <CUTOFF-th=the> the issue right now is that there's nothing there <IVER>
right <LAUGH> <IVER>
the <CUTOFF-ri=right> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it <SIL> it might <SIL> uh it might <SIL> um i was gonna say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campaigns i've seen in recent years utilizing college age students has been clinton's campaign both times <SIL> uh he knew he needed to get a base to increase <SIL> um his chances of winning the election <SIL> and did especially in the first campaign in and and i believe that was ninety two <VOCNOISE> did a really super job of organizing college students because that's when you're at your most um <SIL> well when you believe in things and you're at your most idealistic <SIL> and you would think that yknow <VOCNOISE> kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that <SIL> um <SIL> in addition to that <SIL> and as an <SIL> under current it wasn't <SIL> overt in the clinton campaign <VOCNOISE> but i know when i talked to people <SIL> uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion is an a very divisive issue in this country and i think it it does mobilize people <VOCNOISE> but it also divides them <SIL> yknow <CUTOFF-d=definitively> definitively almost like in vietnam almost like that war divided people <SIL> um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton <VOCNOISE> because it was the difference between protecting roe versus wade and not <SIL> and in protecting choice yknow i um <SIL> and i i'm starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign there i've seen a couple of editorials in the paper <SIL> about yknow the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three <SIL> supreme court justices and at that if you want to protect that right <SIL> you've gotta vote with the candidate who's gonna put the best justices on the supreme court <SIL> and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way <CUTOFF-b=both> <SIL> both in ninety two and again in four years <CUTOFF-la=later> in ninety six <SIL> uh and i think that's gonna happen again <SIL> uh because the <VOCNOISE> the candidates and i'm telling you my politics here <LAUGH-very_clearly> and early <VOCNOISE> but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already <SIL> i know which one will protect the right for choice <SIL> uh and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> uh i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i don't think it's an <SIL> issue that if you <VOCNOISE> did <SIL> overtly and said yknow support candidate a over candidate b <VOCNOISE> because they'll protect abortion rights <VOCNOISE> that's gonna divide the country and not keep us together <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> and that's essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it's right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme <VOCNOISE> court was right or wrong <SIL> it's been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it <SIL> would create too much <SIL> <VOCNOISE> too many problems for people <SIL> yknow which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but yknow it's too late <IVER>
right <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> um-hum <SIL> which meant she'd never get the nomination because of who controls the republican party <IVER>
