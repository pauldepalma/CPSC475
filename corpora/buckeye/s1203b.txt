<IVER>
and a lot more um <VOCNOISE> different suburbs so maybe it's <VOCNOISE> it's going and <HES-and> becoming a little wealthier <IVER>
and <IVER>
i don't think it's <CUTOFF-really=really> i don't think it's really affected me <CUTOFF-tha=that> i mean obviously there's more places to go shopping or to <EXT-eat> or you there's more traffic <LAUGH-laugh_I> don't particularly care much for <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> but <HES-it> <HES-I> don't think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other <VOCNOISE> <HES-it> <HES-and> it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood <VOCNOISE> <EXT-it's> it was where <HES-you> you went to school with the people once at least once i went to highschool i went to public school <IVER>
um <SIL> and you kinda knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that's still <VOCNOISE> that's still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> so i don't <CUTOFF-thing=think> <HES-I> me personally other than <VOCNOISE> other than the fact that maybe there's a couple more things to do there's bigger more comfortable movie theaters and <VOCNOISE> and that kinda stuff <HES-it> hasn't really <IVER>
affected me and i can't say that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that maybe if <HES-it> if it would have stayed small <EXT-maybe> <VOCNOISE> maybe <HES-I> could notice some kind of a difference <LAUGH-that_way_but> <VOCNOISE> but <HES-I> i never <VOCNOISE> <HES-I> i haven't noticed anything <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i can see that i yknow uh like i said for me i kind of <HES-a> <VOCNOISE> i kinda stay where i am so it's not that i really travel <HES-out> into some of those other areas <SIL> more <VOCNOISE> so i mean <CUTOFF-w=well?> it doesn't really affect me personally <SIL> maybe that's <EXT-bad> <LAUGH-I_don't_know_maybe_should_I> <CUTOFF-j=just> feel guilty <LAUGH-about_that> but <IVER>
but <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <VOCNOISE> i think there's uh you they're so many small communities like even <HES-O> o s u is really a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> obviously its own its own little community and then you've got <VOCNOISE> yknow dublin and they've got their own parades and their own different things so i agree i mean i think that <VOCNOISE> that you there really is a lot of things to do in our own individual area that <VOCNOISE> i can't see somebody from dublin going over to <VOCNOISE> the west side <HES-to> to do <LAUGH-anything> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yknow what <HES-I> i don't <VOCNOISE> and uh maybe also <HES-I> i feel safer <VOCNOISE> where i live too and and that's something that's an issue for me i know when i <VOCNOISE> do travel down cleveland avenue it makes me it does it makes me nervous <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> i just kinda stay away from that <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH=I_don't_know> <SIL> i don't wanna get shot <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well it's <HES-kinda> it's kinda hard when you've got <LAUGH-your> <VOCNOISE> your <CUTOFF-v=?> limited choices here yknow some of it some of the issues i thought were kind of <VOCNOISE> important but when you're looking at the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> mayorial candidates <SIL> did you watch that debate <IVER>
oh was <LAUGH-horrible_it_was_a_horrible> <VOCNOISE> because you watch it and you think <HES-uh> oh my god <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i don't want either of these people <IVER>
i mean <CUTOFF-Dod=Dorothy> dorothy peters obviously been around for a really long time and i uh <VOCNOISE> i would tip i'm <VOCNOISE> my views are typically a little bit more democratic but i'm not too say that i certainly wouldn't vote <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> for the person that i thought would do the best job <IVER>
but when you look at coleman he <SIL> <CUTOFF-thi=thinks> <SIL> thinks <VOCNOISE> there was <CUTOFF-a=a> <SIL> point where they <CUTOFF-sai=said?> they asked a yes or no question <IVER>
and neither one of these folks <SIL> could <HES-answer> it yes <SIL> or no and they're going <VOCNOISE> just answer yes or no they'll tell you <VOCNOISE> well i think i stated my point very clearly when i was <VOCNOISE> no the answer is yes or is it was <VOCNOISE> it was um <VOCNOISE> healthcare <EXT-for> <VOCNOISE> living partners <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> it's a simple question <VOCNOISE> yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it just <VOCNOISE> drives me nuts that <VOCNOISE> yknow and i know that that from a p r stand point you don't wanna <VOCNOISE> you don't wanna shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like the <VOCNOISE> damn it <SIL> yknow if you're running for office <SIL> you should just <SIL> just be up front <IVER>
just say how you feel <IVER>
yknow because i just think it looks so awful when you can't you can't even admit to what <HES-you> what you're opinion is <IVER>
yknow and <HES-and> it's just <VOCNOISE> i think that that happens so often there are too many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when you're talking circles around yourself <VOCNOISE> but you never say anything <IVER>
so that's <SIL> that's frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think <SIL> i don't want either one of these people there should be a none of the above <VOCNOISE> yknow if there was <HES-uh> that option i'm sure a lot <CUTOFF-mo=more> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
really yknow i agree i mean none of the above you go and i think a lot more people would certainly go out <VOCNOISE> they would vote for none of the above and they we can have some more candidates <IVER>
i think that would be perfect <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i think it would <IVER>
well i think it's true <HES-you> <HES-you> don't vote because you think i don't want either one of these people what does it matter <IVER>
<HES-he> who cares so yknow people just think <VOCNOISE> there's no really no point to even vote <VOCNOISE> <HES-since> it's too bad <VOCNOISE> really is <IVER>
hum <VOCNOISE> transportation issue <VOCNOISE> that was kind of a <VOCNOISE> i thought that rail system looked kinda cool yknow which is <VOCNOISE> which is kinda tough the question is do we wanna spend the money on it <VOCNOISE> and will people actually use it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think a lot of it goes back down to traffic and you're like yknow people driving both ways <VOCNOISE> and i think if people are <CUTOFF-actu=actually> if they're gonna make it so people are actually gonna <EXT-use> it <SIL> i think i probably a <CUTOFF-b=pretty> <SIL> pretty good thing to have <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and <HES-I> i voted for <LAUGH> <LAUGH=which_I_know_Jason_said> <VOCNOISE> i can't believe you're gonna do that <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> and i <VOCNOISE> i just i guess i just felt like <SIL> i don't know it's it's kinda <HES-I> <CUTOFF-mea=mean> <LAUGH> <SIL> i don't i just think that that's kinda neat and if you're looking at traffic and <VOCNOISE> and i could see if i was going downtown and coming back <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the amount of money that you pay to park downtown is <VOCNOISE> <SIL> outrageous <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> even <CUTOFF-ju=just> just having <HES-to> takes <SIL> i know when it's when it was snowing because i worked on <HES-I> worked on front street <VOCNOISE> and where i would come <CUTOFF-fro=from> i live on bethel road which is <VOCNOISE> i'd take bethel to three fifteen <VOCNOISE> down <SIL> through downtown and it would take me an hour and forty five minutes <SIL> in the snow <VOCNOISE> to get down there and if i could <VOCNOISE> if i could jump on this rail system and it would take me fifteen minutes and i wouldn't have to pay fifty dollars a month for parking <VOCNOISE> <HES-why> why not do that <VOCNOISE> and all there's also the whole pollution thing and <VOCNOISE> and those types of things so i thought that was <IVER>
really <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
really and people use do people use them <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hum <IVER>
uh-huh <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
wow <SIL> that's great <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that's great <IVER>
to do that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah and i think there's a whole bunch of people that just don't wanna spend any extra money on anything <VOCNOISE> we're already paying for enough things you don't wanna do this <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-I_don't_know_how_that's_even_possible> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
but i don't understand is this <HES-can> with the construction they start <SIL> everywhere yknow you think that you would start one area you put a whole bunch of people and they'd work real fast and they'd get that done <VOCNOISE> and then they'd move on <VOCNOISE> but it's like <VOCNOISE> every single <LAUGH-place_in_the> city's got like four guys working <HES-and> you think what the hell you doing over there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
really <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> then the people that are doing you think why do you why are we hiring these guys yknow what are they what are they <LAUGH-thinking> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well they have <IVER>
yeah it's projected like six years to take <CUTOFF-p=place?> to finish some of these projects <VOCNOISE> own <SIL> real <VOCNOISE> well i know we drove through georgia <SIL> you actually see people working on the road there's a whole bunch of people and they're all out there working <VOCNOISE> yknow and you get to ohio there's that <VOCNOISE> i don't know something on david <EXT-David> letterman had a picture of this and i think i've seen it before that big sign that says <VOCNOISE> your tax dollars at <EXT-work> yknow and there's the construction guy smoking a cigarette leaning up against the sign <VOCNOISE> kinda thing <LAUGH> <LAUGH-like_great> <LAUGH> it was a kinda funny <IVER>
well i mean <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no i <HES-think> <HES-I> i just think that typically you see a lot of <CUTOFF-peop=people> lot of places that are that are under construction not very many people working there <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN-what's_a_barrels> <VOCNOISE>
