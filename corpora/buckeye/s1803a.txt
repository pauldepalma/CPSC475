<SIL> <CUTOFF-ch=watch> on tv and in the movies <IVER>
that <SIL> that is what's making the <SIL> these kids think they <SIL> they can do it <SIL> i just really think <IVER>
i think it's too late <SIL> i do <NOISE> <SIL> i <IVER>
personally i think it's too late <SIL> because <SIL> they can get things on the internet <VOCNOISE> yknow there's just so many things <SIL> so many <VOCNOISE> avenues for them <SIL> to <SIL> find <SIL> violence and pornography and yknow <HES-things> <SIL> things that <SIL> we <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> when i was growing up <SIL> we just <SIL> there was no way i could <SIL> see any of that stuff i had good parents but i <SIL> i was in to <SIL> yknow <SIL> lassie and tom and jerry i mean yknow these but yknow they weren't violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but <HES-I> <SIL> i just think <SIL> i don't think it could <VOCNOISE> <SIL> turn back <VOCNOISE> right now <VOCNOISE> i don't know <IVER>
there's just too much diversity <IVER>
in the world <IVER>
and too much prejudice <SIL> there really is still and it's sad but <SIL> it there really is <IVER>
yep <SIL> i do <SIL> i really do <VOCNOISE> i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of thems from their parents but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> it's amazing how many guns and they say that <VOCNOISE> the police are selling guns <SIL> to people and they don't realize <SIL> yknow their old guns that they confiscate and they don't realize where they're going i mean that amazes me <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> but there's always gonna be <SIL> the underworld and <VOCNOISE> different <SIL> ways that kids and people can get guns <SIL> and it's sad i don't know how we could ever <SIL> limit that but <SIL> there's so many millions of <SIL> guns in the world that <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> you're wondering where are they all coming from <SIL> um <SIL> i think <VOCNOISE> but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new <VOCNOISE> guns that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> not just a safety lock but <SIL> yknow you <VOCNOISE> it's like identification thing <SIL> yknow <IVER>
only the <ERROR-only-er=owner> can do it i mean <SIL> seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that <VOCNOISE> the people who have guns and <SIL> in their home and not have them <SIL> locked up or in a <VOCNOISE> yknow in a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> place that no child could find it <SIL> they're to blame <SIL> they are they're to blame <SIL> um <SIL> that whole thing with the um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> school out in colorado <SIL> um <SIL> i forget the name of it but <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents didn't <VOCNOISE> were clueless i just find that really hard to believe <SIL> if a child goes in to a garage every night and you hear clanging and <SIL> and they're buying gun metal and <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> <SIL> then they were totally <SIL> um <SIL> not in tune with what their kids were doing <SIL> it's one thing them having a site on the internet <IVER>
it's another thing that they're in their own <SIL> in the house where the parents are every night <VOCNOISE> and not going in to the garage and finding things <IVER>
i just can't believe and they said they didn't even know what was going on <IVER>
it is <IVER>
um <SIL> <IVER>
i do because they weren't <SIL> yknow they weren't <SIL> in their <SIL> children's lives enough <SIL> you know they weren't talking about things being open about things at dinner <SIL> yknow finding out about school <SIL> um <SIL> i <CUTOFF-k_ih=can't> you can't blame them for having a site on the internet not too many <VOCNOISE> <SIL> parents would know that that they their kids yknow <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but no i think i i i put the blame on the parents <IVER>
i do i think <SIL> they <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow if you're open with your kids nowadays you have to be with <SIL> everything that's in the world <SIL> mean my parents never talked to me about drugs or anything <IVER>
and it was just when <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the drug culture was just <SIL> yknow starting we learned about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me <SIL> or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but <SIL> today with teenagers and everything so out in the open <SIL> you have to talk to them about things and just say <VOCNOISE> you know <SIL> i want to help you and i <SIL> yknow be there for them a hundred percent obviously <SIL> those parents were to busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing <SIL> so i think they're the ones to be <SIL> to blame i do <IVER>
yeah <SIL> not that they could have stopped it but they <SIL> they should have known what was going on <SIL> uh i really think <SIL> if they were close with their children they would have known <SIL> something was wrong <SIL> especially with these kids <SIL> here are so removed and <SIL> don't talk to their parents and start dressing <SIL> certain ways <SIL> you know that they're <SIL> yknow going a <SIL> turning a different <LAUGH> <SIL> yknow <SIL> i just <SIL> i blame them though <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
but they lived in a beautiful home <SIL> i mean if you're to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> kids like that i could see <SIL> if they're <SIL> in a <SIL> poor in harlem or whatever <SIL> but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful home in colorado i mean yknow <SIL> i just think they were <SIL> removed from what their children <SIL> or their son was doing <IVER>
totally <IVER>
yeah <SIL> i don't think that though yknow women need to work <SIL> and <SIL> most families do need two incomes <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and <SIL> plus when kids go into high school <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know you have <NOISE> pardon me you have to worry about them but <SIL> yknow you <SIL> you have to let them experience some of life <SIL> on their own <IVER>
that's a big growing period yknow from junior high to high school is when you really <SIL> learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life <SIL> um <SIL> my mother was always home she was <SIL> um <SIL> which was good to come home to because i had friends <SIL> whose parent mothers weren't there and they had to clean and they had to start dinner and they hated it yknow i mean and they <SIL> feel that they kind of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> missed out on things <SIL> um <SIL> but <SIL> i think <SIL> yknow kids <SIL> lot of them who have <SIL> when they <VOCNOISE> parents have money <SIL> and um <SIL> both parents worked i'm not sure if the columbine <SIL> if both parents worked but <SIL> i don't think <SIL> just the mother being home there <SIL> would have totally helped <SIL> no <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well <SIL> i don't think they should be responsible i think <SIL> um <SIL> kids go to school <SIL> and they need role models good teachers <SIL> um <SIL> and i think schools have gotten a lot <VOCNOISE> better about that it seemed like in the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> late eighties early nineties yknow the schools <SIL> a lot of them were really bad <SIL> um <SIL> i think <SIL> finally <SIL> the education <SIL> department or whatever is <SIL> realizing that <SIL> parents need help with their kids they can't <NOISE> do everything and <SIL> yknow they just need really positive things when they do go to school <SIL> and <SIL> yknow i think teachers are a big part of it <VOCNOISE> i really do <SIL> yknow you remember when you have a good teacher and that you've learned a lot <SIL> um and i think <SIL> yknow through education <SIL> because it's hard all these schools in so many rural areas and everything <SIL> try to get good teachers and then <VOCNOISE> yknow it's always have to do with money and them not <VOCNOISE> making enough money which <SIL> the teachers don't make enough money <SIL> and they're overworked and all these big large classrooms <SIL> and it just seems to me <SIL> when kids start <SIL> dressing and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> getting in a clique together <SIL> yknow would be hard for them to <VOCNOISE> intervene and <HES-say> say oh what's going on in your life what's your <VOCNOISE> what's the problem you know that's <SIL> that's not really <SIL> should be their role <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> if they care enough they should call the parents and say <UNKNOWN> look we're worried about your son <SIL> he misses lot of school or he's starting to dress really <SIL> ynkow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> sometimes and it shouldn't be that dress <SIL> has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids <SIL> go a different way <SIL> it does involve dress <SIL> and <SIL> just <SIL> yknow <SIL> turning against the norm of the society <SIL> yknow <NOISE> <SIL> and if they don't want to be in sports that's fine there are so many different things they can do in <SIL> in school and learn about arts and music and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> unfortunately a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools <SIL> to more or less pick up the slack <SIL> of what <SIL> the parents can't do <SIL> but in some ways <SIL> it's always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home <SIL> yknow <SIL> i mean <IVER>
well <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
i think it would help <SIL> i do <SIL> i am against religion in school <SIL> i just don't think <SIL> they should push that on people <IVER>
um <SIL> yknow <SIL> i mean i don't think they should make people pray if they don't want to before class or anything yknow like that <SIL> but as far as morals and the right <SIL> thing to do in life and <SIL> what's out there and <SIL> yknow most kids know what the wrong thing is but <IVER>
um <SIL> i think <SIL> i think through education <SIL> that's <SIL> it's just gonna only help <SIL> kids because a lot times maybe they don't get that at home <SIL> so they're really looking <SIL> to choose the right thing to do
