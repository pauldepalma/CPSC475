<IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well is there any kind of <VOCNOISE> yknow training i mean do you <SIL> are they doing like the whole <VOCNOISE> job training after the two years or during the two years <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
i think that's great <SIL> yknow i think <SIL> obviously <VOCNOISE> there's always <SIL> a down side and <SIL> but <SIL> i think that <SIL> too many people abuse the system <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> unfortunately <SIL> it's <SIL> very hard when <SIL> yknow <SIL> then it ruins it for the people who really do need it <SIL> and but <VOCNOISE> yknow as long as they have <VOCNOISE> yknow created <SIL> a system <SIL> whereby <SIL> yknow it won't be <VOCNOISE> obviously as good for those people <VOCNOISE> as it has been the ones who are genuinely unemployable but <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> i think <SIL> depending on how <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> sort of focused they are on <VOCNOISE> the individuals in their area or whatever however it's divided up <VOCNOISE> i don't know hopefully <SIL> not special treatment but obviously you would try to steer them more in <SIL> whichever direction they're most suited for <VOCNOISE> yknow as <ERROR-fall=far> <VOCNOISE> far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean <VOCNOISE> yknow there is so much volunteering to be done <SIL> everywhere and even if you don't have <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> if you're lacking in <VOCNOISE> whatever way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-you'd> think that you can <SIL> yknow there is something <VOCNOISE> yknow hopefully that <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i don't know <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> um-hum <IVER>
actually they're they are working on it i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you uh <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> they've <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they've um just instated some bonus schemes where <VOCNOISE> as <SIL> the poverty <CUTOFF-lete=level> <SIL> level i think is considered um <SIL> thirteen <SIL> thousand pounds a year <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> and if <VOCNOISE> if you're below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like <SIL> extra <SIL> bonus <VOCNOISE> beyond <VOCNOISE> yeah so there's a bonus for back to work <VOCNOISE> you mentioned earlier about like how this would effect the children with this two year welfare thing <VOCNOISE> i mean at least <VOCNOISE> i know a lot more about <SIL> the system there for <SIL> <LAUGH-for_whatever> reason than i do about the system here which is kind of unfortunate but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> there i mean <SIL> i don't really think <SIL> and a lot of situations <VOCNOISE> of course <SIL> i i'm sure there are people who follow it <VOCNOISE> as it should be and who <SIL> who really need it and who really <VOCNOISE> yknow taking care of their children but unfortunately you don't really see that side very much you see the people who like <VOCNOISE> their kids see none of that money <SIL> yknow they're left at home by themselves <SIL> if <VOCNOISE> if they can even <VOCNOISE> yknow get them to school if they even go to school if they're even bothered yknow <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow those <SIL> yknow a lot of there's there <CUTOFF-doc=documentaries> documentaries on all the time there so you really <SIL> it's sort of <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> it's more in your face than it is here at <SIL> that i ever noticed um <VOCNOISE> but i do think <SIL> and and <SIL> with that they have specific programs for the children and <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that yknow <VOCNOISE> if a <SIL> if a kid has bad behavior or <VOCNOISE> yknow bad attendance that you send them home i mean i think that's the most ridiculous thing like surely that's <SIL> not a punishment for a lot of these kids <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> at least in england <VOCNOISE> on these things i've seen yknow they send them home and these kids are just <SIL> doing whatever <VOCNOISE> going around the neighborhood shoplifting bullying <SIL> yknow hotwiring cars at the age of yknow ten or something and <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think <SIL> i do have <LAUGH-sort_of_very_strong_opinions> about <SIL> people <VOCNOISE> yeah who <VOCNOISE> are having all these kids and don't take care of them <SIL> at all <IVER>
um <SIL> yes i <VOCNOISE> haven't they talked about that here actually <VOCNOISE> have they talked about <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> right with the human rights <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> personally i think it's a good idea i mean uh <SIL> i <VOCNOISE> i mean <SIL> to me <SIL> yknow <SIL> it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support <VOCNOISE> yknow and that <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i come from a completely different yknow background and everything else and <SIL> the education and a lot <CUTOFF-m=? yknow <SIL> then most of <VOCNOISE> probably the people that this would <VOCNOISE> um concern <VOCNOISE> but i do think <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i don't know <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> with uh the <CUTOFF-b=birth> <SIL> birth control that is available <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> all the options that there are <VOCNOISE> <SIL> sometimes <SIL> i find it <SIL> hard to be sympathetic for <VOCNOISE> yknow these people who just have so many children that they can't feed they <CUTOFF-t=take> can't take care of <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean <VOCNOISE> it's not like <SIL> it was <SIL> way back when when there was nothing and <CUTOFF-y=you> <SIL> you were just stuck this way i mean a <NOISE-woman> can <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> protect herself <SIL> if <VOCNOISE> yknow the <CUTOFF-m=man> <SIL> the man isn't willing to do it or whatever <VOCNOISE> so and and <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> adoption and all the other things <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i mean i feel <VOCNOISE> i lean toward no <VOCNOISE> i don't have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> crack mothers <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but again like the argument <SIL> there on the human rights side was that if they're <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> on cocaine or whatever they can't <SIL> make <SIL> the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like <VOCNOISE> can they make the sound decision to have children <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> um well <VOCNOISE> as far as the racism issue first <VOCNOISE> uh they showed some figures on the news and actually <VOCNOISE> it was <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> more <VOCNOISE>
