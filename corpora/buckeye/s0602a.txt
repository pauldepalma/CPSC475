they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it <SIL> and <SIL> pretty much <SIL> all the other problems <SIL> well there weren't really too many other problems i mean the economy's <SIL> doing really <LAUGH-well> and <SIL> foreign relations <SIL> are always shaky but <SIL> they're getting a little bit better <IVER>
i'd probably vote for bush <SIL> over clinton <SIL> <IVER>
i don't think that'd change my mind about anything i mean <SIL> i don't <SIL> approve of his immoral behavior but <VOCNOISE> it doesn't change the way he runs the country <IVER>
i'm just more of a conservative person i mean <SIL> i'm not sure exactly what his platform is <SIL> but i've seen him speak a couple <EXT-times> <SIL> and <SIL> i don't know he just <SIL> impresses me more than al gore <IVER>
al gore really doesn't entice me at all he claims he invented the internet <LAUGH> <IVER>
all this other stuff <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no it'd probably be <EXT-something> with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind <IVER>
<SIL> or some kind of tax program <IVER>
that would probably affect my decision a little bit <IVER>
because i worked with a guy that was a cocaine addict for a while <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and <SIL> he couldn't have any kind of caffeine otherwise he'd get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills <IVER>
to help <SIL> calm him down <IVER>
and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right <IVER>
and that type of person i don't think would make a very effective president because <SIL> i don't know president needs to be able to think fast on their feet <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that would probably change my decision a little bit <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i don't think i could vote for a violent president <SIL> i could vote for a president that made some mistakes with <VOCNOISE> their personal life <IVER>
gun control <SIL> i'm not really too interested in <SIL> i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns in the street <SIL> big huge <EXT-guns and <SIL> they're one of the safest nations in the country <VOCNOISE> then you look at england they have no guns at all and they're <SIL> relatively safe <SIL> so i mean <IVER>
it's <SIL> more our society than the guns i believe it's more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself <IVER>
guns should definitely be kept in a lock box <SIL> where kids can't get them <SIL> besides that there's not a whole lot that <SIL> government can do it's more the parents' responsibility to keep the guns out of their <SIL> kids' hands <SIL> <IVER>
no the worst thing that happened was a wallet got stolen out of a locker <IVER>
yeah <SIL> pretty much <SIL> <IVER>
here at college i really haven't witnessed any violence at all <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i haven't seen any fights i haven't seen anyone get shot i mean you read about it in the lantern but <VOCNOISE> the only thing that i was really shocked about was <SIL> the people begging on high street <IVER>
yeah that's really not something you see in worthington <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> i agree that we should help them <SIL> maybe through some sort of government <SIL> program <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really doesn't motivate them to get out of the gutter <SIL> i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they're probably gonna stay with that because it's real easy life <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
it's about the same <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> they use drugs but not to the extreme <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that <SIL> college students do <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
high school <SIL> marijuana <SIL> acid <SIL> mushrooms <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-error=that> i didn't know anybody in <VOCNOISE> high school but in college i know some people that have used <EXT-coke> <SIL> ecstasy <SIL> it was more after the movie go <SIL> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it was about a <SIL> bunch of teenage ravers <IVER>
and i mean <SIL> i don't think a lot of people have ever heard of ecstasy until that movie <IVER>
kind of <IVER>
it's like an advertisement for it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah i mean a lot of people really <VOCNOISE> that i knew anyway didn't know about ecstasy until they saw that movie and <EXT-then> <SIL> it was the whole talk <EXT-of> <SIL> high school whatever <SIL> <IVER>
there were a couple that would go to raves every now and then and use it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> downtown <VOCNOISE> abandoned warehouses that get rented out for a night <IVER>
<SIL> they're pretty much all underground things they have a web page up i'm not sure what the address is right now <SIL> <IVER>
no i've had friends go <VOCNOISE> i was gonna go to one on halloween but didn't <IVER>
not really at parties parties are usually just <SIL> mostly kegs <SIL> sometimes there's pot sometimes there's not <IVER>
usually <VOCNOISE> <SIL> every weekend <IVER>
mm-hmm <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
they go to clubs <VOCNOISE> they go to bars clubs um raves <SIL> any place where there's dancing <IVER>
and there's lighting effects like strobe lights disco balls <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
not at all <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
mm-hmm <VOCNOISE> parties didn't change at all <IVER>
no kids just think oh it can't happen to me i'm invincible <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he was recovered <SIL> uh he was about thirty four years old <IVER>
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but <SIL> it took him a while to catch on to things <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
there's a lot more in college college it's seven nights a week <IVER>
you can go anywhere <SIL> get something to drink <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
mm-hmm <IVER>
there's a mild fear it seems the cops always
