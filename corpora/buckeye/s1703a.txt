if you weren't here well <VOCNOISE> he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in ah <SIL> twenty or twenty-five years or something like that and he killed somebody and he was on death row and he wanted to be executed <VOCNOISE> and i thought that's a cop-out if there ever was one just to <SIL> give him a lethal injection and let him go <SIL> he should have rotted in prison for <LAUGH> no that's not a punishment <VOCNOISE> he was off his rocker <VOCNOISE> there isn't anybody who murders who isn't insane <IVER>
yknow technically there's insanity and there isn't insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who isn't insane <SIL> and uh <SIL> just to <SIL> to <SIL> knock them out <SIL> is <SIL> is not appropriate <SIL> they need to be <SIL> we need to try to <SIL> save them <SIL> i mean <SIL> not in the terms of a christian saving but <SIL> uh <SIL> to make them work that off <SIL> and uh <SIL> face it <SIL> and come <SIL> in their <SIL> own mind to their own guilt <SIL> and um <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> um <SIL> so <SIL> i got two sides to that once they need to work <SIL> because they did it and the other side is <SIL> if we keep uh <SIL> i <CUTOFF-a=?> <SIL> i believe in the <CUTOFF-ca=cause?> <SIL> uh <CUTOFF-l=law?> <SIL> uh reincarnation and the law of cause and effect <SIL> and if a person murders somebody they need they'll they will pay for that later there's no question about that in the next life <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> also i think that they should be made to face their <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> their guilt and what they've done and and <SIL> a lot of them don't they say that hardened criminals <SIL> real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to they need to <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <CUTOFF-who=whole> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well what um what my opinion on our whole penal system is just <SIL> yknow <SIL> well it goes along with not <SIL> <CUTOFF-i=?> kind of neglecting the kids in our schools <ERROR-tright=right> now and we're definitely <CUTOFF-ne=neglecting> <SIL> neglecting criminals they need to have <SIL> be educated and <SIL> and worked with <SIL> i mean they need to obviously they some place some point they've <SIL> uh learned <SIL> incorrect <SIL> reasoning or whatever you call it and and they need to uh <SIL> they need to have psychological help <VOCNOISE> period <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um-hum yeah <IVER>
<CUTOFF-e=evolution> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
that's where we are in our <LAUGH-evolution_on_this_planet> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> there's a lot <SIL> we need to do a lot of evolving <LAUGH> <SIL> we <LAUGH-definitely> do <IVER>
um-hum hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
i don't know uh in <SIL> <CUTOFF-we=well> <SIL> i don't <SIL> uh for a while we got it stopped the <VOCNOISE> thing that <SIL> is <SIL> uh <SIL> confusing to me <SIL> is that sometimes we'll get something stopped for twenty five <SIL> or <SIL> thirty years or ten or fifteen <SIL> and then we go back it's like hey we got moved ourselves out of that <SIL> why are we going back to it now <SIL> um <SIL> and and i think <SIL> yknow the papers keep saying that our <CUTOFF-cri=criminal> <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> crime rate is going down and everything <SIL> and so <SIL> uh <SIL> i think that's because we <SIL> some people are <SIL> yknow trying to make it <VOCNOISE> deal with these people as people the who are ill or are sick and try to help them with their <SIL> you <VOCNOISE> yknow it took us a long time to figure out that <SIL> alcoholism is a disease okay and uh so now we try to help <CUTOFF-a=alcoholics> alcoholics <SIL> well well <SIL> <CUTOFF-ug=?> certainly <LAUGH-murdering_is_a> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-dis=disease> <LAUGH-serious_illness_that_needs_to_be> <SIL> helped not <EXT-just> yknow <SIL> um <SIL> well stick them in a <VOCNOISE> place where they can just concentrate on it even more <SIL> so <SIL> we got a long ways to go there <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um yeah <IVER>
yeah anger <SIL> it's always anger <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well <SIL> i'll have a <CUTOFF-r=?> <LAUGH> maybe when i <SIL> i'm a hundred i'll have that figured out <IVER>
because i went to oregon <SIL> and of course <SIL> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> the greater part of the population out there are more <SIL> socialists than they are capitalists and they're easier to deal with and they're more reasonable people in my <LAUGH-opinion_much_more_reasonable> <VOCNOISE> but then i come back to columbus and all my family and and <SIL> and all <SIL> i'm the minority in my family <LAUGH> <LAUGH-believe_me> <LAUGH> and uh <SIL> they're very in to capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so <NOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> so um <SIL> it seems <SIL> the picture is kind of <VOCNOISE> hard to deal with people that are in to capitalism have <SIL> a <SIL> <CUTOFF-p=pretty> <SIL> pretty good lives <SIL> and they have what they want and they don't uh <CUTFF-s=seem> seem to have such serious problems so <VOCNOISE> people who try to go against that current can get it theirselves into big trouble <SIL> so <SIL> and capitalism has made the united states go i mean it has worked <SIL> uh and we are ahead of the world there's no question about that and what the individual people <SIL> persons have and how their lives go much better <SIL> on the other hand <SIL> um <SIL> yknow i'm <SIL> i'm actually what i would like <SIL> <CUTOFF-fo=for> <SIL> uh <SIL> if it would just spread all over the world <VOCNOISE> true communism <IVER>
true communism <SIL> not as it was practiced in russia but <SIL> uh <SIL> where people <SIL> um share and uh <SIL> share power and share money and <SIL> equally but with the where we are in our evolution that we're not ready for it <CUTOFF-I=I> <LAUGH> actually i <CUTOFF-lib=lived> when i was in oregon i did a lot of experimenting and i lived in an intentional community which was <SIL> actually <SIL> trying <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> to <SIL> <CUTOFF-di=?> we never used the word <LAUGH-ever> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> i'm sure plenty of people used the word <LAUGH-on_us_you_know> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but we <CUTOFF-tr=tried> uh we shared everything <SIL> that we had <SIL> and <SIL> supposedly <SIL> we had a true <SIL> uh <SIL> sharing <SIL> but <SIL> um <SIL> in terms of government i don't <SIL> we weren't ready for that because we had more of a matriarchy <SIL> one woman who was <VOCNOISE> decisive and made <SIL> decisions and we would <LAUGH> <LAUGH-go_along_with_her_yknow> <VOCNOISE> but um <SIL> if a <SIL> if a <SIL> we could get ourselves to the place where it would work <SIL> that would be great <SIL> and i would <SIL> very <CUTOFF-mu=much> and i <SIL> then in the year that i lived in that community was one of the <CUTOFF-b=best> <SIL> best years of my life <SIL> it was <IVER>
um <SIL> the reason <SIL> that it was one of the best years of my life is <VOCNOISE> it's in a <CUTOFF-k=?> <SIL> incredibly beautiful setting <SIL> and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people <SIL> and it was mostly of course young people but they were <SIL> incredibly <SIL> idealistic <SIL> and <SIL> incredibly searching for answers <SIL> in <SIL> um <SIL> i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions <LAUGH> as a matter of fact the that's only thing i <ERROR-felten=felt> <SIL> difficult about <SIL> about living there was <VOCNOISE> they would be asking all these <LAUGH-incredible_questions_and_I_would_be> trying to <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-do_the_dishes_or_something_mundane_like> that it's like <SIL> i don't want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions
