there were things out but there's nothing like what they have today you know the small little hand guns and things like that they're real easy <VOCNOISE> carryable and concealable i mean <SIL> like you know back in the sixties stuff like that i mean they had switchblades things <LAUGH-like_that> yeah i mean <VOCNOISE> i mean there's really nothing <VOCNOISE> too different <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<SIL> um <SIL> i sort of agree with the fact that <SIL> if someone wants a gun they'll get a gun <VOCNOISE> it doesn't matter what they do to try to make it <SIL> so people can't get their hands on guns <VOCNOISE> they're basically always gonna be around and people are always gonna get them if they want them <IVER>
i think more what they need to do is <SIL> in strict <SIL> or <VOCNOISE> uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> because i mean for the most part <VOCNOISE> i mean people really don't get <VOCNOISE> too badly punished for things <VOCNOISE> i mean if you look in other countries i mean <VOCNOISE> like people <VOCNOISE> like the <VOCNOISE> asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws <VOCNOISE> i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism you're still serving jail time and you get <LAUGH> you get pretty badly punished for it <VOCNOISE> i mean some cases they'll even <SIL> chain you up and beat you in public for it <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i think <VOCNOISE> not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way <VOCNOISE> that there'd be a much less problem with it <VOCNOISE> um i think just the fact that the jails are so over crowded now that they know that they're gonna get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff <VOCNOISE> that if you shoot someone you're <VOCNOISE> you're not even gonna get thirty days in jail and <VOCNOISE> you're gonna be <VOCNOISE> let go i mean that's an awfully small price to pay for <IVER>
just carrying around a gun and shooting someone <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i don't really know honestly i mean <VOCNOISE> it's definitely careless nature and definitely something has to be done to 'em <IVER>
but at the same time it's not like they had the intent <SIL> to do it <VOCNOISE> so i can't say anything too incredibly severe <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but i mean i almost think it should be <NOISE> considered basically <SIL> child neglect things like that um <VOCNOISE> basically the same penalties that you'd run into for that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i mean <UNKNOWN> they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids <VOCNOISE> has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> i mean that's just <VOCNOISE> sort of the curious nature of kids i mean they <VOCNOISE> obviously they're gonna <VOCNOISE> get into stuff and things like that and i mean it's not always the <VOCNOISE> parent's fault i mean <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-kn=know> there are a lot of people i mean <VOCNOISE> i think just in the news a few weeks ago they <VOCNOISE> had a shooting that happened couple of years ago and they just came to a verdict on it <VOCNOISE> and the parent like left in a <CUTOFF-t=top> top drawer of a tool shed that was locked <VOCNOISE> and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked it and he ended up shooting himself with it <VOCNOISE> i mean as far as that goes i mean there's really nothing more he could do i mean <IVER>
yeah i mean <IVER>
it's just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that's <SIL> sort of kids for you i mean they just <VOCNOISE> obviously they're gonna be curious about things <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it <VOCNOISE> but i don't know <CUTOFF-w=what> to what degree <VOCNOISE> that they should go with it <IVER>
nothing serious no <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> not really i mean <VOCNOISE> i've been with a few people that have <SIL> just <NOISE> i mean just <VOCNOISE> randomly gotten kind of jumped i mean they didn't steal anything they just <VOCNOISE> beat them up for no reason or what not <IVER>
but i mean it's was nothing too serious or violent i mean <IVER>
they didn't like pull out any weapon or anything like that it was just a fistfight yeah <IVER>
happened sometime <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> probably would've been my <CUTOFF-ow=?> <SIL> my freshman year in high school <VOCNOISE> um we were just <VOCNOISE> walking down high street and <LAUGH> i guess we were <VOCNOISE> wrong place at the wrong time and <VOCNOISE> some people <VOCNOISE> were like yelling stuff <VOCNOISE> and we couldn't make out what they were saying <IVER>
and one of my friends was like what'd you say <VOCNOISE> and he took that as like a threat or something like walked over <IVER>
and just <LAUGH-started> picking a fight with him <IVER>
just <IVER>
to beat him up <VOCNOISE> but <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um <IVER>
they probably would've been <VOCNOISE> um about seniors in high school or so <IVER>
juniors or seniors in high school i mean it wasn't anything too <VOCNOISE> serious it was just more <VOCNOISE> i guess a testosterone trip or something <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh <UNKNOWN> definitely yeah like i said <UNKNOWN> parts no different <IVER>
uh <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> it's probably would be worse <VOCNOISE> i mean actually <VOCNOISE> just wait for my last experiments i heard couple people talking about it they were talking about it <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> i can say <VOCNOISE> there are some drugs that <SIL> i don't really consider to be too threatening or <VOCNOISE> that i'm really too worried about people using <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> like i mean just the whole idea with marijuana things like that i mean <SIL> it doesn't really <VOCNOISE> bother me so much i mean <VOCNOISE> cigarettes and alcohol basically do the same thing it does <IVER>
and i mean those are legal <VOCNOISE> obviously <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> obviously things like once you start getting into cocaine p c p things like that those are a little bit more serious <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> obviously a lot more dangerous and <VOCNOISE> i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with <VOCNOISE> the bigger drugs <VOCNOISE> once you get it to like college or whatever <IVER>
as back into <CUTOFF-gr=grade?> into high school <IVER>
um <IVER>
i've been to parties and things like that where people were shooting up with like heroin and things like that <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> i mean that's <VOCNOISE> pretty <VOCNOISE> i don't know extreme yeah <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so i mean it's definitely i would say this more serious drugs are definitely <IVER>
much more widely used once you get into college <VOCNOISE> um but i mean as far as like the pot and just things like that i mean i can't say i see any difference between <IVER>
here and high school <VOCNOISE> ecstasy is the drug i've been hearing about <VOCNOISE> a <LAUGH> a lot the past <SIL> like year or two and it's definitely something that's grown <IVER>
just like almost out of control <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> it's pretty <VOCNOISE> dangerous drug i would say for the most part <VOCNOISE> um not so much <VOCNOISE> the getting high part of it but just what goes into it <IVER>
uh like i know one of the <VOCNOISE> poisons used in it is like rat poison or something like that <VOCNOISE> i mean just obviously the idea of putting rat poison into you when it's meant to kill a rat <VOCNOISE> obviously seems pretty dangerous <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
um <IVER>
ecstasy yes <VOCNOISE> there are a few people that i know that <VOCNOISE> use it <IVER>
like on a fairly regular basis even <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i mean nothing's happened to them and <VOCNOISE> i mean like i said <VOCNOISE> the high getting high part of it <VOCNOISE> isn't so much of the problem it's just what goes into it <IVER>
um so i mean basically <VOCNOISE> my opinion on that is just leave it up to them <VOCNOISE> i mean if they wanna take the risks obviously they know <LAUGH> <IVER>
the risks and what goes into it <VOCNOISE> and like i said i mean it doesn't really hurt anyone the high part of it <IVER>
um i mean basically all they do is sit on the couch and <LAUGH> and smile and laugh at basically anything that's said for four or five hours <IVER>
and i mean that's about it but
