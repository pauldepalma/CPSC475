right <IVER>
oh right <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>

right <IVER>
<EXT-right> <IVER>
and just totally bombarded and i mean here it's so force fed as well i mean i <VOCNOISE> i <HES-came> <SIL> home just before halloween <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow i <CUTOFF-w=?> <VOCNOISE> i walked into the grocery store and i mean just like <SIL> right there were just like <NOISE> <VOCNOISE-cakes> <VOCNOISE-cupcakes> cookies like <SIL> everything just right in front of you <VOCNOISE> with like all this halloween stuff on and i mean <VOCNOISE> all the holidays in here are <HES-so> pushed at you and <NOISE-it's> such a money making <SIL> yknow and it's so over the top where there it's sort of like <VOCNOISE> there's a little bit of that and there are decorations and stuff at christmas but it isn't so much <VOCNOISE> yknow and <VOCNOISE> and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around i mean there <SIL> there isn't that <VOCNOISE> at all <SIL> i mean at least <EXT-in> <SIL> yknow <SIL> my <NOISE-experience> there and i mean i can't imagine <VOCNOISE> because yknow western europe i think <HES-is> <SIL> sort of as much like <VOCNOISE> america as you can get <VOCNOISE> probably <SIL> yknow <SIL> most <VOCNOISE> places elsewhere in <VOCNOISE> in the world <SIL> and i mean <VOCNOISE> <SIL> that would have been a fantastic experience <IVER>
right <IVER>
right right <IVER>
wow <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
absolutely <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> there's the whole theory that <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it has to drop back at some point <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i don't see it happening <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> any <VOCNOISE> time in the near future <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> <ERROR-ydow=yknow> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> as with a lot of the resentment that's felt <SIL> that i experienced toward americans <VOCNOISE> <SIL> rather saddeningly i think <SIL> our culture is starting <VOCNOISE> to really <VOCNOISE> infuse itself into <SIL> europe at least <VOCNOISE> i mean i see instead of <VOCNOISE> us becoming more like them yknow <NOISE-them> becoming more like us walmart has bought yknow <SIL> a <HES-big> <SIL> uh retailer there so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> and and it's just it's moving there the whole <SIL> yknow strip malls and i was in <SIL> i spent my first <NOISE-Christmas> there in belgium with a friend and i mean <VOCNOISE> we would drive by and she'd be like oh <VOCNOISE> this is because of yknow your country these people are moving in and buying <NOISE-whatever> and <SIL> so <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-conversely> i see it moving in the other direction unfortunately rather than <IVER>
really <IVER>
wow <IVER>
<LAUGH-oh_really> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
is there <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> the resentment to things like mcdonalds there <EXT-too> <HES-or> is it <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right right <IVER>
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there were a lot of jibes <SIL> about that i remember <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> driving <VOCNOISE> to germany <VOCNOISE> with a couple a english friends and <SIL> to visit some german friends of theirs and <SIL> we got there and it <SIL> we <CUTOFF-we=were> got lost and all these things that took us way longer than it should've and <VOCNOISE> a friend of the person we were visiting said like <VOCNOISE> oh what did you have to stop at every mcdonalds along the way and i was like <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i'm a <LAUGH-vegetarian> i don't even eat at mcdonalds yknow and <VOCNOISE> i was <HES-just> <SIL> yknow and it was really mean it's like <NOISE-that> isn't really a very good joke <VOCNOISE> and that kind of thing came up <VOCNOISE> quite frequently but <VOCNOISE> yknow i always said <SIL> mcdonalds wouldn't survive here if no one ate there and you can't tell me that everyone in there <VOCNOISE> is american <IVER>
and they never were i mean the same with <VOCNOISE> like in france especially oh mcdonalds <VOCNOISE> well mcdonalds was full of all the french people yknow i mean <IVER>
