<SIL> highly <SIL> skilled or trained in that area i mean <SIL> you can't really do a simple sort of screening and <SIL> these are good and these are bad uh and <VOCNOISE> again as i mentioned previously <SIL> i think it's more to do with <VOCNOISE> maybe being aware of the interaction <SIL> of <SIL> yknow the different students with each other and <VOCNOISE> i mean if it was as bad as <SIL> they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and <VOCNOISE> i mean you're you're never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and different cliques but <SIL> i can't help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would <SIL> do something like that <VOCNOISE> that <SIL> yknow <SIL> had to have been more than just <SIL> yknow sort of <SIL> normal <SIL> jocks versus <SIL> whatever <SIL> so i think it should be more <VOCNOISE> i don't know <SIL> i mean even <SIL> yknow i went to a <SIL> private <SIL> catholic highschools <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> even there yknow there was <SIL> yknow uh <SIL> a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on <VOCNOISE> should definitely not have been going on and that was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> only on a very small level there were eighty six people in my graduating class yknow and i mean <SIL> this is a highschool with like several hundred students that this happened at so <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <VOCNOISE> i think in fifth grade <SIL> was the first <IVER>
um <SIL> i mean at that point <SIL> i uh <SIL> i certainly didn't have <SIL> any uh <SIL> real <VOCNOISE> knowledge <LAUGH-about_any> of that sort of thing <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yknow they covered <VOCNOISE> the basics <SIL> <EXT-um> <SIL> they did talk about condoms and <VOCNOISE> um contraception <VOCNOISE> i remember we <VOCNOISE> watched a film <SIL> which everyone was very embarrassed by <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i mean i don't really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh they uh they did send home a packet to the parents <VOCNOISE> because i remember being really upset and not wanting my mom <LAUGH-to_talk_with_me_about_it> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> yknow i think what they did was <SIL> fairly good they didn't really <VOCNOISE> as far as i remember at that point at least they didn't <SIL> well they must have done gone into the sort of moral issue <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> but it i <SIL> what i remember was more of a scientific approach <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
all i remember is <SIL> them talking about condoms i don't think they talked about <SIL> anything besides that <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> then again <VOCNOISE> i could <LAUGH-be_remembering_wrong> <VOCNOISE> um but yes that <HES-I> mean <VOCNOISE> it is the stance but i think <VOCNOISE> in the schools <SIL> i mean that's sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they're a little bit more realistic <SIL> i mean this wasn't <SIL> i mean it was a catholic school but we didn't have nuns or anything there i mean <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yknow i think <SIL> they were sort of <SIL> more concerned with <SIL> yknow <SIL> it it actually it might have been later than the first <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a <ERROR-coup-ah=couple> <VOCNOISE> like eight grade that they talked about condoms <SIL> i doubt that they would've done that that early now that i think about it <VOCNOISE> but i know that there was at one point <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> some sort of <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> not really <VOCNOISE> <SIL> because i think <SIL> yknow <SIL> <EXT-if> <SIL> if they're going to <SIL> they're going to and <SIL> i don't think <SIL> a lot of them at <SIL> that stage are gonna go out of their way to go <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and buy them so i don't think it's like <SIL> oh i have a condom i'm going to have sex <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean actually it's <SIL> this <VOCNOISE> is is very hot topic in england right now because they they've got <SIL> the highest rate <SIL> of teenage pregnancy in the world <VOCNOISE> and i mean there are stories everywhere about <SIL> yknow twelve year olds having babies and <VOCNOISE> i mean there they've gone to distributing <SIL> condoms on playgrounds which i do think is <SIL> a little bit <VOCNOISE> too much i think maybe having them available in the nurses office is one thing <VOCNOISE> they're there <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> they can go and <SIL> and <SIL> get some or something but i think actually like physically <VOCNOISE> yknow passing them out is a bad idea <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow uh <SIL> because of the simple fact of the statistics that they're they are doing it so <SIL> at least <SIL> at the very least they might as well be <VOCNOISE> yknow safe about it <IVER>
um <SIL> well actually <SIL> it's <SIL> sort of all happening in a certain area <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow with <SIL> yknow very high unemployment like council <VOCNOISE> council states <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> yknow <SIL> the sort of stereotype yknow kind of bad family environment <SIL> yknow <SIL> parents have lots of <SIL> boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and <VOCNOISE> yknow a lot of these <VOCNOISE> girls that have been interviewed <SIL> yknow say oh yknow i wanted something to love or <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling <SIL> and <SIL> yknow a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed was saying <VOCNOISE> oh yknow he had <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> slept with like <SIL> ten girls or something and <SIL> i'm thinking <SIL> oh my gosh yknow and he's thirteen and <VOCNOISE> yknow had a few kids and <VOCNOISE> that was it but <VOCNOISE> in my opinion the main problem there is <VOCNOISE> they get more support <SIL> even at that age <SIL> when they have <SIL> they <SIL> yknow they get unemployment because once they've had a kid even if they're not <VOCNOISE> of working age they get like a <SIL> an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think <CUTOFF-f=fifteen> <SIL> um fifteen or sixteen <VOCNOISE> if they have a baby they're provided they're <CUTOFF-li=like?> <SIL> the top of the list for a council house <VOCNOISE> so they get their own there was actually a <SIL> long documentary on before i left <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yknow of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> yknow her parents were at the end of their rope <VOCNOISE> she got pregnant and she was like well <VOCNOISE> yknow hey <SIL> this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets <SIL> money for herself money for the baby she doesn't have to pay any utilities or anything <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> yknow <SIL> what more <VOCNOISE> could she want <SIL> yknow was basically what she was saying <SIL> i've got my own place i can do whatever i want i'm getting money and i don't have to work <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> and so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that i think is a very bad situation because they're almost rewarded for <SIL> yknow <IVER>
