<VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> i <CUTOFF-n=?> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-I> didn't <SIL> start dating until i was almost seventeen <VOCNOISE> but almost everybody else <CUTOFF-st=started> <VOCNOISE> had <VOCNOISE> even <VOCNOISE> i'm gonna be thirty six here in a week or two <VOCNOISE> so we're <LAUGH-talking> i graduated in eighty <EXT-two> <VOCNOISE> where <EXT-now> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-k=kids> i think kids are <CUTOFF-s=starting> dating at <SIL> like <VOCNOISE> ten <LAUGH-eleven> <LAUGH-twelve> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> heaven forbid <VOCNOISE> but <LAUGH> i'm sitting here going <VOCNOISE> i mean <VOCNOISE> i didn't even know what i was doing <IVER>
when i started dating at <SIL> almost seventeen <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> so no i think <VOCNOISE> i think you learn a lot from your family <VOCNOISE> and the way their relationships are <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> i personally don't think a school can do it <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i think they can help <VOCNOISE> but i think it has to be something that <VOCNOISE> society in general or family <IVER>
unit does it <VOCNOISE> um and it wasn't that i had a bad family unit it was just that <VOCNOISE> there wasn't yknow we never talked about it <VOCNOISE> my <LAUGH-sister_and_I were just talking about that because <NOISE-we_were> <VOCNOISE> she goes <VOCNOISE> we were like <CUTOFF-w=?> <VOCNOISE> yknow how did people start talking about <SIL> <EXT-sex> and relationships and what not she goes <VOCNOISE> you don't <CUTOFF-mem=remember> mom and dad handed me a book <VOCNOISE> i'm like they did <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'm like i don't remember that <IVER>
and she goes well after i read the book i asked them a lot of questions so maybe they didn't give it to <LAUGH-you> <LAUGH> yknow like how we don't wanna go through this again <VOCNOISE> because she's a little <LAUGH-older_than_me> <VOCNOISE> i thought that was hilarious <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
like <VOCNOISE> you mean sexual relationships and what <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> probably the <CUTOFF-r=?> <VOCNOISE> the bad things about it <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> um but just coming from my christian beliefs and what not <VOCNOISE> the best thing and i know it <SIL> even though i didn't partake in it when i was a teenager and i wasn't promiscuous at all <VOCNOISE> but i still had sex before marriage <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> just to be <VOCNOISE> it'd be nice if they teach you how to be confident in your self <VOCNOISE> and i don't mean like self esteem but <VOCNOISE> yknow like <SIL> we said if if uh <VOCNOISE> yknow you come from a situation like that that doesn't mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
right <VOCNOISE> well kind of like <VOCNOISE> just because everybody else is doing it this way doesn't mean it's the right <EXT-way> <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> yeah <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> <VOCNOISE> yknow i really struggle with that <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE=I> <SIL> i come more from i think the family should teach it <VOCNOISE> but let's be realistic how many families are gonna do that <VOCNOISE> or <VOCNOISE> have the <VOCNOISE> mentality to do that <SIL> it seems like um <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> sound like my dad <LAUGH-but_it_seems> like these days <VOCNOISE> most of the people a lot of people that are having kids <VOCNOISE> shouldn't be <IVER>
and the people that <VOCNOISE> would be decent parent aren't <VOCNOISE> because of the <VOCNOISE> situations and what not <VOCNOISE> um just my <CUTOFF-fam=family> <SIL> nobody in my <CUTOFF-fam=family> my sister doesn't have kids i don't have kids <VOCNOISE> we're in our mid to late thirties <VOCNOISE> um our friends just had one <VOCNOISE> um i do have some friends that have <VOCNOISE> like more than one <VOCNOISE> which is great <VOCNOISE> because they're just great parents i'll know those kids are gonna be going in <VOCNOISE> but then <SIL> i have uh other people that <VOCNOISE> like my other friends that just had one <VOCNOISE> were trying to help a a child <ERROR-nin=in> children services <VOCNOISE> that came from <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> imagine it and that's basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids <VOCNOISE> by three different dads <VOCNOISE> and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually <VOCNOISE> had her move in with them <VOCNOISE> they were her temporary foster parents <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> she just turned sixteen <VOCNOISE> so she was fifteen when she moved in with them <VOCNOISE> she refused to change <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i don't know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier <VOCNOISE> but basically <VOCNOISE> all three of them <VOCNOISE> i don't wanna say are doomed but <VOCNOISE> they're not <SIL> even though they're out of that environment <VOCNOISE> they're not doing any better <IVER>
so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> yeah so it's kind of like <VOCNOISE> i'm for education in schools but <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> just like the bad things about it yknow <SIL> sex can do <VOCNOISE> you can get pregnant number one <IVER>
which isn't fun <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-and> number two yknow the diseases and things like that <VOCNOISE> i think that's a good idea <VOCNOISE> to teach just <SIL> that it's not all <VOCNOISE> uh fun and peer pressure and stuff i know i kind of got off track there but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
hum <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> because they're gonna learn that on their own <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-a=I> <VOCNOISE> i personally think that it's a choice <SIL> i don't think you're born that way <VOCNOISE> because <CUTOFF-a=I> i <VOCNOISE> i have friends <VOCNOISE> that are homosexual and <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yknow <CUTOFF-wa=?> i don't believe in what they're doing but <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-I_don't> do everything right everyday <VOCNOISE> so i still love them and they're my friends and blah blah blah because <VOCNOISE> but i've also known people that <VOCNOISE> were that way <VOCNOISE> and now are heterosexual and are much happier <VOCNOISE> and they realize that it was just a choice they made and things like that <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> so it's <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> in today's day and age they're gonna learn about it <VOCNOISE> quickly <IVER>
and i don't really think it's something that needs to be taught <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the only thing <VOCNOISE> probably <VOCNOISE> is like <VOCNOISE> what do they call that uh <VOCNOISE> cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think <VOCNOISE> that i don't think is such a bad idea <VOCNOISE> uh because just because you grew up in <VOCNOISE> i don't know <VOCNOISE> what i grew up in but i'll i'll give an example i didn't grow up in let's say <VOCNOISE> somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to country music <VOCNOISE> doesn't mean if somebody doesn't do that <VOCNOISE> they're not okay <VOCNOISE> i think that would be a good idea or yknow cultures all are different <VOCNOISE> so if you wanted to view that as a culture or <VOCNOISE> do yknow what i mean <VOCNOISE> that that <VOCNOISE> is something different <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> accept the people you don't have to like what they're doing <VOCNOISE> but they're still people <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> it's hard because i i do come <CUTOFF-a=across> <VOCNOISE> i'm a christian <VOCNOISE> so i believe that homosexuality is wrong <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> i don't like i said i'm not gonna condemn them <VOCNOISE> um at all <VOCNOISE> like i said i have friends <VOCNOISE> it <VOCNOISE> i understand what you're saying <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> but i think that's something more for <VOCNOISE> the parents <VOCNOISE> or the teacher to pick out <VOCNOISE> that maybe that child <VOCNOISE> um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort <VOCNOISE> and not actually incorporate it <SIL> in a <VOCNOISE> thirty student <VOCNOISE> ensemble <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> uh it'd be nice if we had more of an open environment in schools and if teachers really had the time <VOCNOISE> to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talk to them about it <VOCNOISE> and then send them on that counseling <VOCNOISE> one on one way <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> just because <VOCNOISE> if you're gonna teach it to um a large amount of <VOCNOISE> students <VOCNOISE> i'm not even sure if that one <CUTOFF-sh=?> student would listen because all the rest of them <ERROR-wund=would> probably be making cracks and just make them feel <EXT-more> <VOCNOISE> do you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> <EXT-so> i don't <CUTOFF-f=feel?> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> yeah <LAUGH> <IVER>
<EXT-so> <EXT-I> yknow they probably all hey you resemble that remark or <LAUGH-ynknow> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-I=I> so i hesitate to say that it would really help them <SIL> um it would just be better if somebody could <VOCNOISE> yknow keep their eyes open <VOCNOISE> or if we <EXT-had> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> more counselors or things like that to deal with everything <VOCNOISE> including that <IVER>
normally i would say no <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> i do <VOCNOISE> just because <VOCNOISE> let's face it <SIL> <LAUGH-they're_probably_gonna> do it anyhow <VOCNOISE> and i would feel better for them <SIL> and if <CUTOFF-i=if> <SIL> if they used it because <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> it's not good for the children that are born it's not good for them <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i'd prefer abstinence but let's be realistic <VOCNOISE> yknow i think we're past that point now <VOCNOISE> um i know a lot of christians argue oh but you're wrong <VOCNOISE> well yeah i might be wrong but <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-we> <VOCNOISE> we can't go backwards on that i don't think <VOCNOISE> you can only work on your own <IVER>
it's <IVER>
right <IVER>
<CUTOFF-eh=?> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-eh=?> <IVER>
is not gonna work <IVER>
right <IVER>
even though i knew better at the point <SIL> when i <VOCNOISE> was faced with that at seventeen or whatever <VOCNOISE> i wanted to be <ERROR-dloved=loved> so bad that it was something that <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE> yknow what i mean <VOCNOISE> and i knew better but you just yknow <VOCNOISE> and it's like well <VOCNOISE> i wasn't that strong granted but <VOCNOISE> i was probably <CUTOFF-m=?> <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF=m=most?> normal teen and <VOCNOISE> i think most of the people i knew at that age <VOCNOISE> were <VOCNOISE> lost it much younger than seventeen <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> ok <LAUGH> eleven twelve it's like ew he we even look alike <LAUGH> forget it <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> yeah so i think i think birth control would be good <SIL> and <VOCNOISE>
