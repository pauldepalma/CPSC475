right <VOCNOISE> that's true <IVER>
<NOISE-that's> true <IVER>

<NOISE-bad> acoustics really <IVER>
shocking <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
oh my <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <LAUGH> well <VOCNOISE> speaking of acoustics <VOCNOISE> i i don't know <NOISE-if> i'm <UNKNOWN> you'll have to tell me if i'm going off the subject <LAUGH> or yknow if you need to ask me something else <SIL> <NOISE-okay> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> this is another interesting story <VOCNOISE> my <VOCNOISE> church <VOCNOISE> choir <VOCNOISE> is very important <NOISE-part> of the <NOISE-church> up there on <EXCLUDE-name> have you ever been to the church up there <NOISE> should <VOCNOISE> visit sometime although <VOCNOISE> you're only <NOISE-going> to be here for another month <VOCNOISE> summer is not necessarily the best time to visit <IVER>
<NOISE-yeah> <NOISE> but um <VOCNOISE> just to see the church <VOCNOISE> might be fun <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> about <VOCNOISE> how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build <VOCNOISE> a new <VOCNOISE> worship center building <VOCNOISE> and because we were really <SIL> too <SIL> too big <VOCNOISE> for the <NOISE> sanctuary that we had <IVER>
and um <VOCNOISE> so basically they decided to build a new building <VOCNOISE> adjacent to <VOCNOISE> the church <VOCNOISE> tacked on <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> they asked the choir <VOCNOISE> for input <IVER>
as to what the sanctuary should be <NOISE-like> <LAUGH> so <NOISE-we> had a tour <VOCNOISE> uh the choir took a tour our choir director <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> arranged it <VOCNOISE> to about six five or six churches in the columbus area <VOCNOISE> to <NOISE-sing> in them <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-and> <VOCNOISE> not <NOISE> for an audience but just to sing <NOISE> and to see which ones <NOISE-we> liked the <NOISE-acoustics> of <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> that was <NOISE> interesting we sang <VOCNOISE> in uh <VOCNOISE> we sang in <NOISE-central> <NOISE-Presbyterian> <NOISE-Church> downtown <VOCNOISE> which was <NOISE-where> this <VOCNOISE> my one of my orchestras plays a lot <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we didn't <LAUGH> maybe it had some feedback i think the <NOISE-new> <NOISE-building> <NOISE-is> acoustically very good <VOCNOISE> it's <NOISE-certainly> <VOCNOISE> much <NOISE-better> than <VOCNOISE> old <VOCNOISE> worship center because <VOCNOISE> i don't <NOISE> know if you've seen a picture or anything of the church <VOCNOISE> the old worship center <VOCNOISE> was designed by a modern architect to be a modern <VOCNOISE> quote unquote type building in nineteen <NOISE-sixty-two> <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> it's <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <NOISE-it's> <NOISE> it's <VOCNOISE> flat <NOISE> <NOISE-there's> a <NOISE-flat> <NOISE> <NOISE-roof> <VOCNOISE> with a <SIL> clear story <VOCNOISE> in the middle <NOISE> it has <NOISE-nothing> in <NOISE-just> <NOISE> it's just empty <NOISE-space> <VOCNOISE> over the <VOCNOISE> over the worship center <VOCNOISE> <NOISE-so> <NOISE> when you would sing in that as a choir you spread out along the front <VOCNOISE> if you were under the <VOCNOISE> high <CUTOFF-s=?> <SIL> place <SIL> your <NOISE-voice> <NOISE-would> go <UNKNOWN> <NOISE> all <NOISE-of> <NOISE-the> way to <NOISE-the> <NOISE-back> <VOCNOISE> but if you were <NOISE-under> this flat ceiling that's only about <VOCNOISE> seven or <VOCNOISE> that's only about nine or ten feet high <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <NOISE-it> was <NOISE-dead>o <NOISE> it was <NOISE-just> <NOISE-muffled> <LAUGH> and um <VOCNOISE> it was <NOISE-terrible> <NOISE-acoustically> <LAUGH> <NOISE-but> <NOISE> yknow we made do <NOISE-with> <NOISE-it> <VOCNOISE> for many years <VOCNOISE> and then um <NOISE> and then <NOISE> we had the <VOCNOISE> the <NOISE-chance> to get this input into this new <NOISE-building> and it's <VOCNOISE> it's uh <VOCNOISE> it's really beautiful it's a circular <VOCNOISE> almost circular big <VOCNOISE> uh <NOISE> space with a <NOISE> <NOISE-high> point in the <NOISE-middle> of the roof <VOCNOISE> and uh <VOCNOISE> it's it's <NOISE-nice> <LAUGH> <NOISE-well> you could still go it's they won't have they won't <NOISE-have> a lot of um <IVER>
music <NOISE> during the summer but they'll have <VOCNOISE> regular worship service <NOISE> i think they're at ten <NOISE-thirty> <NOISE-now> <VOCNOISE> on <NOISE-Sunday> <NOISE-mornings> <VOCNOISE> i <NOISE-had> lot of times skip <NOISE-most> <VOCNOISE> during the summer <LAUGH> <IVER>

right <VOCNOISE> but how old is your <NOISE-kid> <IVER>
you could <VOCNOISE> but you could take her to <IVER>
oh okay <VOCNOISE> well the reason i asked was a lot it <NOISE-seems> to me a lot of <NOISE-the> impetus for going to <NOISE-church> or going back to church for people <VOCNOISE> is when their kid gets old enough to <VOCNOISE> go to sunday school <LAUGH> starting <NOISE-asking> questions about religion and you're saying <VOCNOISE> well i suppose i could answer all of these but <LAUGH> yeah <IVER>
right <IVER>
