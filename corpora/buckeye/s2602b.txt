kids <SIL> because they're only little once <SIL> that's what i tell myself when i get really really frustrated <VOCNOISE> they're only little once and they will be grown up before i know it <LAUGH-because> <IVER>
<NOISE> <SIL> yeah because i mean five years went by like <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah it was <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah because i don't have a degree <IVER>
i went back and did a one year <SIL> um schooling <HES-to> <SIL> get <HES-my> <VOCNOISE> nursing license i became an l p n <SIL> so <SIL> i don't have a degree my husband has a degree i put him <SIL> through school <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-I> <LAUGH-finished> <VOCNOISE> finished his private school <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
wittenberg <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
eventually <IVER>
yeah <SIL> we'll see where i'm at in five years <VOCNOISE> i know everybody is like well don't you want to go back for your r n i'm like <SIL> after working with r n's and <VOCNOISE> we were doing the same things basically and they didn't get paid much more than i did so i was like well what a waste yknow <VOCNOISE> go to school <VOCNOISE> for nothing basically just to learn a few more theories <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-I> <LAUGH-could> <LAUGH-come> <LAUGH-up> <LAUGH-with> <LAUGH-my> <LAUGH-own> <LAUGH> <IVER>
just <IVER>
a little bit of both i think i <VOCNOISE> looked into some phonics i went to the library checked out some phonic tapes let him watch those cause <VOCNOISE> kids love to watch things <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> and just reading with him and going over things and <VOCNOISE> it's it's been amazing just to see it's like the light bulb comes on and <IVER>
yeah and he can sound out things and he can even spell things just from his own understanding of phonics and <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> i've i been pretty impressed i'm like wow you got that really really close to being the right spelling <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
just from what he's learned <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i mean most of it was me going over it with him <VOCNOISE> and just <SIL> yknow i talked to some people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and <SIL> yknow just <VOCNOISE> doing the things that work for him and as an individual <IVER>
i'd say we do oh at least an hour <SIL> or more a day <SIL> something like that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i mean i wouldn't <CUTOFF-se=say> i wouldn't say it was an hour at a time <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but yeah <SIL> and he loves playing on the computer <SIL> doing c d roms and <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> loves watching the magic school bus <IVER>
so i <VOCNOISE> i try to gear what he watches <SIL> towards educational <SIL> programming instead of just <SIL> junk <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
well right now i think he knows enough i'm just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things i'm pretty i'm like wow i can't even build the stuff that he built he makes ships and cars and <VOCNOISE> rockets an <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
i'm <CUTOFF-a=I'm> i'm impressed i'm like ok i tried to build a car and it didn't look <LAUGH-like> <LAUGH-anything> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah so <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
ah <SIL> probably <IVER>
yeah <SIL> nah because right now yknow because he knows how <HES-to> he's he's learned <VOCNOISE> i'd say he knows more than most kindergarteners <VOCNOISE> so i don't even push anything we don't really have a set schedule right now and <VOCNOISE> i'm just letting him be creative and <VOCNOISE> yknow letting him help around the house and <SIL> yknow just <VOCNOISE> if i let him watch something thats educational <SIL> based usually <VOCNOISE> and i let him play on the computer <SIL> we'll go to different websites sometimes to <SIL> check out things and <VOCNOISE> i'm amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from <SIL> day to day <SIL> stuff <SIL> and just listening because he's <SIL> he listens to <LAUGH-everything> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> he picks up toys he'll vacuum he <SIL> puts dishes in a dishwasher and <VOCNOISE> he can <VOCNOISE> um put clothes and take clothes out of a dryer and put clothes away <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
he cleans his <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
he cleans the toilet too because he's a boy and boys <VOCNOISE> even some men don't quite <IVER>
hit the mark sometimes so <SIL> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-he> <LAUGH-gets> <LAUGH-to> <LAUGH-clean> <LAUGH-the> <LAUGH-toilet> especially since most of that is his <IVER>
<HES-or> <SIL> i would say ninety <SIL> nine ninety eight percent <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
because it's hard being the only girl in the <LAUGH-house> <LAUGH> <IVER>
his mom was june cleaver <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> and then they end up okay anyway <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's good <LAUGH> <IVER>
right <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
he'd be lost <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
at the age of ten <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i shouldn't be having to clean quite as much as <LAUGH-I> do now <VOCNOISE> ah mm i'd say by ten <VOCNOISE> they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themself i know i did at then <VOCNOISE> and to be able to do <SIL> their laundry <SIL> maybe <SIL> definitely <VOCNOISE> help out a lot around the house <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
no thanks <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE-you_decide_what_classes_were_gonna_be_taught_and_you_could_just_start_from_the_ground_up_like_you_don't_even_have_a_requirement_you_don't_even_have_to_teach_english_classes_if_you_don't_want_to_or_you_dont_have_to_teach_math_class> um-hum <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i don't think i can answer that <IVER>
on the spur of the moment <VOCNOISE> i'd have to think about that i really would <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i'd <IVER>
yeah i would <SIL> i'd say <CUTOFF-s=something> yknow life application <SIL> things would definitely <SIL> need to be part of it <VOCNOISE> i don't think that you should throw out english or math or <VOCNOISE> yknow <SIL> can't believe i'm saying this history but <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> i don't think you should throw out that stuff but i don't think that there should be as much emphasis on it <VOCNOISE> i think more of the <CUTOFF-empham=emphasis> emphasis should be on <VOCNOISE> life skills and just being able to make it <SIL> on you're own and take care of yourself and <VOCNOISE> but definitely i think that those other <SIL>
