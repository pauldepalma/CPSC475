<IVER>
<SIL> no <VOCNOISE> yeah <CUTOFF-the-they> they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the <VOCNOISE> <UNKNOWN> deduction allowances <VOCNOISE> because even when we reduced deductions it went down too <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <VOCNOISE> and then again <VOCNOISE> uh you say well <VOCNOISE> yknow like well maybe some affluent uh person would donate and it's publicized <IVER>
donate so much don't know <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> okay well that you remember <VOCNOISE> back sometime in may were ninety percent tax brackets and so forth <VOCNOISE> so that means ninety cents on that dollar he gave <IVER>
they didn't <CUTOFF-br=bring> they didn't bring that up <UNKNOWN> <SIL> he only gave ten cents <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> again it gets back to the ten percent tithing <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> i think there's something else in the bible where you know she <UNKNOWN> the <VOCNOISE> lady gives gives <SIL> only a small portion compared to a larger portion but <VOCNOISE> in relation to what her income was <SIL> that meant a lot more <VOCNOISE> and that we need to get more involved in that <VOCNOISE> we need promote more of that <VOCNOISE> if we're going package things materialize we need to think more of that <VOCNOISE> but i think really take hold of the night <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> what would you be doing if you're a third world country didn't have choice <IVER>
<HES-you> you <VOCNOISE> why you be doing eight children <VOCNOISE> and <IVER>
trying to feed eight children <VOCNOISE> and it <VOCNOISE> if you're here in a <CUTOFF-c=country> this country <VOCNOISE> any eight children <VOCNOISE> why you have eight children to start with <IVER>
shouldn't you have little more knowledge little more <SIL> support around you <SIL> educating <SIL> knowing <SIL> self discipline <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> on what's on really on top what's really in crazy is when you have <VOCNOISE> multiple fathers <SIL> and the children don't know the dads <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that comes back to the lack of our morals and the lack of <CUTOFF-self=UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> and our society promotes it <SIL> they're doing a <UNKNOWN> to tax laws in our uh all the government <VOCNOISE> you see government do this government's doing it to themselves <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well i <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
again gets back to being in the home <VOCNOISE> did your mother give you everything you wanted <VOCNOISE> then she failed you didn't she <IVER>
not really <IVER>
well according to the government she would have <IVER>
and you don't the problem is as a youngsters you grow up <VOCNOISE> you don't realize how much your parents did for you until you're <VOCNOISE> probably until you're about thirty <EXT-five> forty you don't realize my goodness mom and dad you made a sacrifice <VOCNOISE> because now i'm learning a little more what you did <VOCNOISE> and then by the time you're <VOCNOISE> uh maybe <VOCNOISE> sixty <VOCNOISE> <SIL> fifty sixty now you got <ERROR-stay_care> <VOCNOISE> take care of your parents <VOCNOISE> if you have the morals to do it otherwise just ship them off to the farm <IVER>
and there's people like that today still <VOCNOISE> you go <VOCNOISE> but i think people should go to <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> retirement centers <VOCNOISE> uh huh <SIL> uh and uh sit down make a visit to them <VOCNOISE> every <VOCNOISE> week <VOCNOISE> make it part of life <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and develop a friendship <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> you'd learn a heck a lot from that uh <VOCNOISE> aging person <VOCNOISE> <SIL> a heck a lot more than you would <VOCNOISE> through interviewing me <VOCNOISE> really <IVER>
no <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> i'm living <VOCNOISE> yeah that's my <ERROR-my_di=UNKNOWN> my um role call <IVER>

yeah <VOCNOISE> and uh <SIL> that's the generation i'm talking about those are generation <CUTOFF-th=they> they they went through the depression and so forth they <VOCNOISE> they were the <UNKNOWN> <VOCNOISE> i <SIL> i i pity i feel sorry for your generation <VOCNOISE> which is my daughter's generation and uh <SIL> part of my son's <VOCNOISE> i because um <VOCNOISE> i <ERROR=g=UNKNOWN> <SIL> i <SIL> i don't see how in the heck the wages aren't going up that much <VOCNOISE> prices are up consumerism's going up <VOCNOISE> <SIL> somewhere along the <EXT-line> <VOCNOISE> uh the consumer is going to have to start getting a little wiser <VOCNOISE> and say well <IVER>
what do i want out of life <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> the trouble is <VOCNOISE> if he does get wiser too much he's usually about forty years of age and he says gosh darn it i wish i listened <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <ERROR> <IVER>
<NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> it <VOCNOISE> it would be interesting <VOCNOISE> to see <VOCNOISE> how much of your generation <VOCNOISE> <SIL> is saving <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-h=how> <VOCNOISE> first of all how much they earning <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> how much they expect to pay for a house <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and all these other things <VOCNOISE> know they they say to you why well i'll save ten percent church <VOCNOISE> then you got <VOCNOISE> oh gee five dollars here <CUTOFF-thr=three> or <SIL> <CUTOFF-may=maybe> twenty cents a <UNKNOWN> twenty cents an hour <EXT-here> you this <VOCNOISE> you figure all those up <SIL> all these campaigns you hear during course a year <VOCNOISE> i often thought it would be great for marketing <VOCNOISE> take all those figures <SIL> and add up and see if it adds up to a hundred percent <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and if it does <VOCNOISE> then where are your goals <SIL> <VOCNOISE> see when i bought a house <VOCNOISE> the financier <VOCNOISE> <SIL> came in i went to his office and he said <VOCNOISE> oh mister <EXCLUDE-name> no problem no problem <VOCNOISE> you can get that house <SIL> i said <SIL> i can <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> you're professional and you're wife's professional <SIL> i said that's how you're evaluating it <SIL> on both of us yes <VOCNOISE> i said then i don't want to do business with you <SIL> why i'm going give you a loan i said <VOCNOISE> i don't want do business with you <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because you didn't ask me about my goals <SIL> <VOCNOISE> my goals was not to have my wife <SIL> work <SIL> <VOCNOISE> because nowadays <VOCNOISE> takes two of them to work <VOCNOISE> i'm <CUTOFF-der=wondering> wondering when they're going to child labor law <SIL> uh revoke that <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> with two of them working <VOCNOISE> i'm wondering how many more hours a day <VOCNOISE> you can squeeze out of a couple's personal life <VOCNOISE> so they'll have sanity <VOCNOISE> at some time in their life to enjoy life <VOCNOISE> when these people start realizing <VOCNOISE> hey <CUTOFF-w=we're> <VOCNOISE> it's <CUTOFF-i-it> <SIL> we're chasing our tails <VOCNOISE> then those two <CUTOFF-coup=couple> that that couple <SIL> got wise and said hey <VOCNOISE> we're going to do with less <SIL> and we're going go for quality <SIL> <VOCNOISE> when that <VOCNOISE> when that couple reaches that mentality <SIL> mister loan officer <VOCNOISE> you're gonna have a greater society to work with <VOCNOISE> and you won't have as many repossessions <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i'm sorry it goes against your goal <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but goes against <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it <SIL> it's more positive for our society <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and that's been it <VOCNOISE> my wife's been working part time <SIL> all her <VOCNOISE> tenure that's fine keep her license up <SIL> she's a nurse <VOCNOISE> the thing is <VOCNOISE> i don't <SIL> want i didn't want her i wanted her to be home with the kids i didn't want somebody else to rear our kids <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and i don't know <VOCNOISE> if our kids realize this or not <SIL> but i do know my <ERROR> my <ERROR> my brother in law <VOCNOISE> mentioned to his uh parents he said <SIL> gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us <SIL> and he just turned fifty <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they don't have any kids <VOCNOISE> and he says <VOCNOISE> wow i don't know how you did it <SIL> well for one thing they probably did <SIL> a lot of sacrificing <VOCNOISE> and when you sacrifice <VOCNOISE> it becomes <SIL> <CUTOFF-i-it> makes you more humble <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> and it makes you a <ERROR> a better person <SIL> because <VOCNOISE> you got the spirituality inside you driving you <SIL> and that's what's gonna take you home <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i often ask of people <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> you ask me about marketing <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ho-how> <VOCNOISE> uh do you think there's a heaven <SIL> <IVER>
and how do you picture it <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> okay <VOCNOISE> see <VOCNOISE> the way i look at heaven <SIL> myself is that <VOCNOISE> i have a chance to meet all my acquaintances i had over the past <IVER>
my family <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and i'll see them face to face <SIL> and i'll recognize them <SIL> and they'll recognize me <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> something transcends them <VOCNOISE> because as i look to them <VOCNOISE> <SIL> unlike when they're on earth <VOCNOISE> my goodness we're taught to learn <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <NOISE> <SIL> the most negative thing about person <VOCNOISE> <SIL> psychology says if you see a blank sheet of paper you see the dot on the thing <VOCNOISE> you don't see the other ninety nine percent of the paper you see that dot <SIL> it's gonna be just the opposite in heaven <VOCNOISE> i can't think of a negative thing about you <SIL> and the reason why you can't think of a negative thing about them <VOCNOISE> because <VOCNOISE> you see christ's <UNKNOWN> appearance coming through them <IVER>
and they see the same thing it's mirrored back to them <VOCNOISE> because we're made in christ's images <SIL> and we can't say no to him <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's what heaven's like that's what we should go to bed at night thinking <VOCNOISE> what did we do positive today <VOCNOISE> and build on the positive it may be the smallest part of that sheet of paper <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> i made a difference i helped someone
