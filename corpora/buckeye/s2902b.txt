you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> can't do this you can't do that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah but i mean yknow <VOCNOISE> a <VOCNOISE-kid> that <SIL> you know might wanna save up for something when he's twelve years old has no chance at all getting a job <IVER>
yeah <HES-you> well we did that too <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
i got one sister <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah she lives over by uh riverside hospital <IVER>
about once a week <SIL> my wife sees her usually more than me <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH-yes> <IVER>
no my mom <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE-she's> not an invalid <VOCNOISE> uh she's seventy two years old but <SIL> they go out <SIL> usually to yard sales <SIL> stuff like that stuff i don't wanna do <IVER>
no offense <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
well put this way <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i was a kid <VOCNOISE> you didn't wanna be brought home by the police <VOCNOISE> you were actually scared of police <SIL> nowadays <CUTOFF-wh=what> what's kids scared of nothing <IVER>
ain't a damn thing they're scared of whenever we were kids we used to make zip guns <VOCNOISE> we'd take an ink pen <SIL> take the pen piece out put a firecracker in <IVER>
put so it fizzed and yknow you'd pack it full and you had a gun <IVER>
you know that the stuff like that's <SIL> always been around <VOCNOISE> but it seems now that <SIL> the guns are more <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you can get them easier <VOCNOISE> it's like me i could be carrying a gun right now what are they gonna do to me <IVER>
they ain't gonna lock me up <IVER>
carrying a concealed weapon they're gonna slap me on the arm <IVER>
now if i shoot you they might do <CUTOFF-sahm=something> i mean don't get me wrong i ain't <VOCNOISE> but i mean if i shoot you they might do something but otherwise than that they ain't gonna do nothing <IVER>
depends upon how i store it now <VOCNOISE> when i was a kid raised up we had gun locks on our guns even though i could pick them <SIL> i mean it <IVER>
gun locks are easy to pick you can break into anything <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but when i was a kid too we used go out turkey shoots and i'd go hunting all the time <VOCNOISE> so i was pretty familiar with guns <VOCNOISE> my kid uh he grew up he was familiar with guns <SIL> he also knew not to touch them <IVER>
if you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> but i had no pistols at my house i had shotguns and rifles <VOCNOISE> now to me a lot of these pistols like a twenty five caliber <SIL> come on there is no use for gun like that <IVER>
thirty eight derringer yknow <IVER>
the only time the use for guns like that is to carry to shoot somebody <VOCNOISE> when i <CUTOFF-w=worked?> <VOCNOISE> yeah when <IVER>
when i worked at bars i carried a gun constantly and <VOCNOISE> most the cops in neighborhood knew i carried a gun <IVER>
but they didn't say nothing to me because they knew the reason why <SIL> it's because i carried the bar receipts <VOCNOISE> now i could see to carrying one to that <SIL> degree but <VOCNOISE> <SIL> there're <SIL> you know there's a limit you got all these people carrying guns because they'll tell you well it's the neighborhood i live in or you have women carrying guns even down here on campus <VOCNOISE> because they walk late at night <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> it's just <SIL> there we go again who's right who's wrong i have no idea <IVER>
and you even got these <SIL> the uh what stunt guns they're the ones that scare me <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> what <IVER>
them little electric shock things <IVER>
i got a bad heart i don't know what that'd do to me <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah but <VOCNOISE> guns are always gonna be around ain't gonna get rid of them <IVER>
but why would you make stricter gun laws when you can't even enforce your traffic laws <IVER>
yknow so basically <VOCNOISE> well yeah it might work but to me it's kinda stupid yknow because what you're saying is <VOCNOISE> we're gonna take this <VOCNOISE> law and <EXT-really> gonna stick you on this <VOCNOISE> law but the hell with all the other laws <SIL> so is that really fair <IVER>
i <IVER>
i've almost been hit i don't know how many times people talking on telephones i see people turning with no turn signals <IVER>
yknow just turn right out front of you <VOCNOISE> everybody's running red lights nowadays <VOCNOISE> mean which laws you gonna pick out to enforce and which laws ain't you <IVER>
uh <SIL> to me if you gonna enforce the gun laws and make them <SIL> stricter <VOCNOISE> what you ought to do is <SIL> put a limit <VOCNOISE> on the barrel length and stuff on guns you get caught with a gun <VOCNOISE> with a <CUTOFF-sg=?> <SIL> barrel smaller than uh <SIL> eight inches you go to jail <IVER>
no ands ifs or buts you go to jail for three years <IVER>
if you got an eight inch barrel on your gun now you tell me where are you gonna put it <IVER>
you isn't gonna get a lot of dates <IVER>
<LAUGH-yknow> <IVER>
but <SIL> you understand what i'm saying it's <CUTOFF-k=?> <SIL> you gonna have to make <SIL> make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE> you can carry a weapon here in columbus <SIL> i can carry a weapon right now as long as out the open <IVER>
course i'm gonna get stopped for suspicious person everywhere i go <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> yknow <HES-I> <HES-it's> still <SIL> the <SIL> it's constitution and stuff like that <VOCNOISE> yknow they always bring it back our forefathers did this and our forefathers did that <VOCNOISE> well our forefathers also <SIL> were squatters does that mean i can move into this room <IVER>
and tell you it's mine now <IVER>
come on yknow <VOCNOISE> people <VOCNOISE> i don't know i'd hate to be in a predicament of having to change anything <SIL> because be hard to change for one group and not another <IVER>
you know <VOCNOISE> so i don't know where to go <VOCNOISE> to me the biggest thing would be if they got rid of these saturday night special guns and stuff like that <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
you're <CUTOFF-s=still?> <IVER>
<CUTOFF-yih=you?> <SIL> yeah you always still gonna have violence like we were kids <VOCNOISE> like me and you would meet we'd get in a fight and after that we'd be best friends now <VOCNOISE> now i'd be walking down the street <VOCNOISE> hell fourteen year olds scare me to death right now <IVER>
not knowing they're gonna whip out a gun or not he ain't gonna go to jail <IVER>
and then they're gonna say they wanna nail their parents <SIL> yknow their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what their kid's doing <IVER>
the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so <SIL> you know what i mean basically all that <SIL> <SIL> all i've ever seen is <VOCNOISE> well like these kids that get in the house <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they go to the house they find a gun and they wanna hold the parents responsible <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yes and no on that <VOCNOISE> if the parents had the gun <SIL> in the house they had the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-uh> <VOCNOISE> ammunition locked up say in the trunk of their car <SIL> what if the kid bought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the gun <IVER>
so basically there's no way <SIL> <UNKNOWN> <SIL> you know unless you have a steel cabinet to put that gun in <VOCNOISE> and there we go <SIL> rich can afford that but the poor can't <IVER>
and most your people that <SIL> own guns that are <SIL> killing people are usually your poorer people <IVER>
most the <VOCNOISE-trouble> i have <SIL> uh i got one neighbor that hates me and he's a sheriff <IVER>
and <VOCNOISE> otherwise no i don't have hardly any trouble with the kids i have more trouble with the parents <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
i don't <IVER>
no i don't fear none of the kids <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yes to some degree they should but there we go again that's just like the people when i worked in bars <VOCNOISE> they'd always want to hold the <VOCNOISE-bartender> responsible <VOCNOISE> but say you could come up <SIL> i give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else <IVER>
but even though you're not responsible i'm the one supposed be responsible <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> people <SIL> yknow that have the beer party in the house <VOCNOISE> yeah <HES-they> they should be held responsible <SIL> to some degree but <SIL> we're in a society that loves to sue people <IVER>
yknow how far are they held responsible i don't know you'd have to go on a case by case basis <IVER>
on that <IVER>
well when <VOCNOISE> when i was growing up there wasn't as that much violence and i could go in indiana and i have done it now <VOCNOISE> my name ain't on this report so you can't do nothing about <IVER>
i picked eighty pounds of pot <SIL> one time growing along the railroad tracks and brought it back to columbus <SIL> eighty pounds <IVER>
<HES-it> it used to grow wild when i was <VOCNOISE-a> kid <IVER>
you could find it all over the place <IVER>
and you didn't <VOCNOISE-have> the violence and stuff like that i have never <EXT-heard> <SIL> and yknow i'm just using pot right now <IVER>
i've never heard anybody going on a <VOCNOISE> <SIL> shooting rampage that were high on pot most of them are sitting home waiting on a pizza <IVER>
<IVER>
<IVER>
<SIL> huh <SIL> and <SIL> it's just like cocaine and stuff like that you know your laws are different crack cocaine is one <SIL> powder cocaine is another <SIL> you know and <SIL> what they're saying <SIL> on that is that's <SIL> a <SIL> prejudice thing is what they are saying because they are saying more blacks <SIL> do <SIL> crack cocaine than powder cocaine <SIL> prison thing i'm sure you
