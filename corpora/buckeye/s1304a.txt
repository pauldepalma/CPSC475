<SIL> yknow and i just told him well it has to do with my belief system so you're in violation of the first amendment <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <EXT-so> and then they realized that i wasn't stupid <SIL> so <SIL> yknow they just made things more and more difficult for me <SIL> yknow so i just decided to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> since they weren't gonna <SIL> <VOCNOISE> change i was just gonna leave <SIL> yknow <SIL> but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> so it's yknow <HES-it's> it's a hard <EXT-way> <VOCNOISE> you choose <EXT-to> <EXT-walk> uh if you're not idealistic person it's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i mean just more so me i i don't <SIL> like i said i don't try and dwell on the negative yknow but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh it very easy to get sucked in to what's wrong out there <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and it's also very easy to get sucked into the attitude well i'm gonna change this <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> you know if you <EXT-can> <SIL> you do what you can do as a human being <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that alone <SIL> is good enough <SIL> <IVER>
and and that's what a lot of people are telling me yknow just <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> life's a struggle <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> anyway <SIL> yknow so <SIL> <VOCNOISE> just simply living <SIL> <IVER>
yknow for me getting out of bed <SIL> is <SIL> is a victory <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow <SIL> for the longest time i was so depressed <SIL> yknow but <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the animals you know yeah using the animals uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh for therapy animal therapy um <SIL> i mean dogs in particular cats <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but know there's <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh there's some animals that aren't <SIL> to be pets yknow um they're wild animals <SIL> yknow and <SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah i saw a show last week on fox that <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> was called when good pets go bad too <SIL> <IVER>
and none of the animals they profiled were pets <SIL> i mean a thirty six foot long python what the hell's a person doing with that as a pet <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> they shouldn't be allowed to <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and then people treating a buffalo <SIL> like they could stand next to it and take a family picture <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> doesn't show any knowledge or respect to the animal <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> that's a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <EXT-in> my opinion when that stuff happens when i see <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when i see someone light the horns of a bull on fire in spain and torment the bull and then all of a sudden the bull gets the flames put out <VOCNOISE> <SIL> and the bull runs his gourd through <SIL> <VOCNOISE> the person's leg and throws him around and kicks him right near death i don't have any sympathy for him <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
oh i'm not shocked to the bad behavior of the <CUTOFF-anima=animal> i don't consider it's justice <IVER>
well i mean <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> well the humans that started it and the man narrating the thing said there wasn't a single animal that they profiled in the thing that uh <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um <SIL> behaved the way it did on it's own accord <IVER>
<SIL> it behaved that way as a result of the way it was being treated by human beings <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> so i mean there's a i mean <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah the animal therapy is very good thing my dog has been very <SIL> <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> supportive been very <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you know like you said the unconditional love part yknow i mean how you could <VOCNOISE> <SIL> you could <VOCNOISE> you could leave for a week and come back and they're <VOCNOISE> they're like ok <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> i'm glad you're back yknow <SIL> <IVER>
