a pizza <IVER>
you know now <IVER>
i've seen more people violent on liquor <VOCNOISE> like said i worked in bars and i'm <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and i've <CUTOFF-s=seen> <VOCNOISE> it's just like cocaine and stuff like that you know your laws are different crack cocaine's one <VOCNOISE> the powder cocaine's another <VOCNOISE> you know and <VOCNOISE> what they're saying <CUTOFF-i=is> <SIL> on that is uh <VOCNOISE> that's a prejudice thing is what they're saying cause they're saying more blacks do <CUTOFF-k=cocaine> crack cocaine than powder cocaine cause of prison thing i'm sure you've read the papers <VOCNOISE> the way i look at it uh i've had four heart attacks every time i have a heart attack okay <SIL> they swear up and down i do cocaine <IVER>
which i've never done i don't want to <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> to me <SIL> some drugs should be legal <SIL> some drugs should be illegal <VOCNOISE> but to me <SIL> alcohol should be more illegal than half your drugs <IVER>
because i've seen more violence <SIL> on alcohol i've seen more women beat i've seen more kids beat <VOCNOISE> i've seen more drunken driving wrecks <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yknow <IVER>
well <VOCNOISE-you've> seen people driving wrong way on the freeway right <IVER>
when they're drunk <VOCNOISE> when's the last time you read about somebody driving the wrong way on the freeway from smoking a joint <IVER>
<CUTOFF-guh=?> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<NOISE-or_either> that or they're so paranoid you know what i mean <NOISE-they're_more> worried about stopping <IVER>
and i'm just using that as an example you know what i mean your other drugs i don't know <SIL> much about them <IVER>
well they always did because first time i had one i was thirty six years old <IVER>
and whenever you have a heart attack anymore they always <CUTOFF-sus=suspect> suspect coke is the first thing <IVER>
because it stops your heart right away <IVER>
yeah <NOISE-that's> what i mean they go by your age too <IVER>
yeah and then when they <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah then when they did the blood test they found out i had hypertension plus <LAUGH-cardiovascular> disease <SIL> had nothing <LAUGH-do_with_drugs> <IVER>
not really you just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah it was painful but no worse than <VOCNOISE> going to the hospital for my back surgery my back surgery was worse than a heart attack ever was <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
uh i blew a <NOISE-disc> out <IVER>
and i couldn't walk at all <IVER>
so they <VOCNOISE> i have o s u insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they wouldn't admit me they told me they were going to <VOCNOISE> make wait two months before they did anything <VOCNOISE> and what i did i had my wife drive me down to the hospital i crawled out of the car crawled into the hospital and told them either admit me or i'd crawl out the door <IVER>
like i told ya i can be an idiot <IVER>
<NOISE-and> <IVER>
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the door as an o s u employee <IVER>
being turned away <IVER>
and for some reason they admitted me then <IVER>
i <NOISE-had> hypertension when i had the first two and then <HES-then> <HES-uh> the last two i had <VOCNOISE> now i got cardiovascular disease i still got one of my arteries <VOCNOISE> about eighty percent blocked i got another one fifty percent blocked and i got a dead spot on my heart right now so when i exercise <VOCNOISE> uh my heart slows down <SIL> let's put it this way where i work at i work here at o s u <IVER>
this will be something good to get on your tape <SIL> and they've got people over there where i work at <SIL> that they will <VOCNOISE> give them the days off if their cats are sick <IVER>
they'll also give them let them work seventy five percent if they're sick i had a heart attack had to come back to work early because i was out of sick leave <VOCNOISE> and like i said i've been here twenty five years and they would not even put me on first shift because they said it wasn't <SIL> a good enough reason <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
until i threatened to <VOCNOISE> sue them <IVER>
second and third i was working sixteen hour days a lot of times covering <SIL> that's one of the reasons they weren't going to move me <IVER>
well my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better <VOCNOISE> if i slept at night instead of staying up <IVER>
cause of your internal clock <IVER>
and i was trying to do everything and then also too they wanted me to go to therapy <IVER>
which was scheduled in the evenings i when was working and i couldn't even go to therapy <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
when i threatened to take them to court <SIL> and it took <SIL> almost two months <SIL> after that <IVER>
but i <VOCNOISE> i had a note in <SIL> before i had the heart attack <VOCNOISE> i'd already had two heart attacks i had a note in that i needed to be on first shift or i'd probably have another heart attack <VOCNOISE> and they would not put me on first shift then i had <VOCNOISE> another heart attack <VOCNOISE> put me in the hospital and then i had a <CUTOFF-h=heart another heart attack when i was in the hospital <VOCNOISE> and when i came out that's when i <SIL> gave them another note stating i needed to really be on first shift <IVER>
and that's when they said no <IVER>
it's <CUTOFF-a=all> <IVER>
it's all documented <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
yeah told me to exercise which i do told me quit smoking which i been trying no offense it's harder to quit <IVER>
uh <IVER>
yeah stay away from salts uh sodium and stuff like that <VOCNOISE> pop uh coffee i don't have no problem there i don't drink coffee i drink a lot of pop though uh <VOCNOISE> <SIL> like pork products <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah because i don't like vegetables my hands are going to sleep <VOCNOISE> i don't like vegetables is what it is so it's real hard for me <IVER>
uh the exercise i do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so <IVER>
but <VOCNOISE> in the winter is when yknow i mean i don't exercise that much <IVER>
my bill collectors are the ones that scared of that <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> it's like this <VOCNOISE> what can i do <IVER>
<LAUGH-you_know_what_I_mean> <IVER>
yeah but you put up with that anywhere it's not just ohio state it'd be anywhere you go yknow <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it's just like i said <SIL> you get excuse me your assholes in <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE-and> they leave then you get <SIL> either another asshole or somebody good you just wait until you get somebody good <IVER>
it's like you're doing interviews <IVER>
you might think i'm <SIL> an idiot but you know what i mean the next person walks in the door might be real good <IVER>
but <IVER>
you understand what i mean <SIL> you just <IVER>
you just keep going that's part of life you pick up something you learn it and you keep going <IVER>
well i <SIL> i work with around mostly black people <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> it's a weird situation uh <VOCNOISE> they're more prejudiced <SIL> that i've noticed now than <VOCNOISE> when i only worked around a couple of them <IVER>
yeah because uh <VOCNOISE> they're more <VOCNOISE> you always hear about my black ass my <SIL> you know what i mean and stuff like this and i could give a shit <IVER>
you know what i mean it don't matter to me whether you're black or white it matters to me whether way you treat me <VOCNOISE> like when i first got out service is when they really started affirmative action i was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they couldn't hire me because of that was when they first come down with a mandate that they could only hire blacks <IVER>
so i was shut out of the job market then uh <VOCNOISE> that didn't even bother me i thought well fine <VOCNOISE> i went that's when i got the job at channel four <VOCNOISE> but uh <VOCNOISE> it's like anything else some blacks use it for good some blacks use it for bad <SIL> <IVER>
and if i was in the <LAUGH-same_situation> i'd be doing the same thing so <IVER>
you know what i mean <SIL> <IVER>
i'm a veteran so <VOCNOISE> i get points for veteran so you know what i mean <IVER>
everybody gets something <IVER>
you're a woman you're a minority <IVER>
<NOISE-so> right <NOISE-there> <SIL> you're over me <IVER>
my supervisor's black my last manager at the hospital was <SIL> black <VOCNOISE> plus my supervisor over there was black <VOCNOISE> my brother in law's black my other brother in law's arab my other brother in law's arab <VOCNOISE> <HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> let's see <SIL> the kids that i just kept <SIL> taking care of for my sister <SIL> in law <VOCNOISE> they're all arabs <SIL> <HES-uh> the three kids i had living with me two summers ago were all black <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> i did have a white kid my son living there and that's about it <IVER>
oh <CUTOFF-y=yeah> there's a lot of racism <IVER>

<HES-uh> <VOCNOISE> your little <ERROR-clitchs=cliques> <VOCNOISE> cliques <VOCNOISE> it's like being back in high school <IVER>
