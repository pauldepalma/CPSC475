<LAUGH-good> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH-okay> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
okay <VOCNOISE> i might want to try to adjust this a little bit again if you say it goes under my <CUTOFF-trik=chair> <NOISE> putting it under here <NOISE> <NOISE-dont'_know_if_that_would_uh> <NOISE> help <NOISE> <NOISE-yeah_that_was_probably_gonna_stay_better> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-okay_now_it's> not <LAUGH> it was better before <SIL> there <SIL> that's better <SIL> that's okay <NOISE> <NOISE-we'll_just_try_that> <NOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE-saying> <NOISE> <IVER>
okay <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> so i can just talk normal and it won't be too loud because i talk loud <IVER>
okay <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <LAUGH> <SIL> so when i start laughing real loud you can <VOCNOISE> turn it down so no one breaks their ear drums <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
yes <IVER>
thirty nine <IVER>
uh north end <SIL> over by riverside hospital <IVER>
henderson olentangy <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um currently unemployed <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
so <IVER>
yeah i'm looking for work um taking my time looking for work <VOCNOISE> it's the first chance that i've had in probably twenty years to sit back and get what i want <NOISE> so i'm doing that <SIL> <NOISE_I'm> <VOCNOISE> getting unemployment and taking my time i've got <SIL> several interviews so <VOCNOISE> some exciting ones so <IVER>
um secretarial <SIL> administrative assistant <SIL> type work <IVER>
uh i'm kind of happy i'm not doing that anymore it really takes a certain <ERROR-kype=type> type of person to work for in that's hard to find <VOCNOISE> in that area so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-i=in> uh in insurance off and on working for independent insurance agents <VOCNOISE> so i did that until i <SIL> uh came to a company that i stayed with for seven years <VOCNOISE> and then they relocated to dallas <SIL> so yeah <IVER>
um <IVER>
i didn't wanna go to dallas <IVER>
so there was a couple people that went but probably two out of five hundred <VOCNOISE> and nobody wanted to <LAUGH-mo=move> <SIL> so i stayed here <IVER>
oh probably my family <SIL> my kids are here <SIL> i have a grandchild now so <VOCNOISE> yeah i like to stay <SIL> close to all them <IVER>
she is four months <VOCNOISE> almost five <IVER>
yeah <SIL> so i'm a new grandma <NOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> thanks <LAUGH> i don't feel like a grandma either so <VOCNOISE> have to be careful what i do they still watch me i guess <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
uh-oh <NOISE> <IVER>
oh <SIL> that's fun and that's a challenging age too thirteen months that's fun <IVER>
yeah <NOISE> <IVER>
um <SIL> no <SIL> i got to babysit for like a week and then she has a best friend that's watching her baby and <VOCNOISE> a friend of hers that has other kids too so it's real good for the baby <NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
yeah it's my daughter <SIL> yeah <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
uh she's actually at uh columbus state <VOCNOISE> she's gonna study to be a teacher <IVER>
so she's doing that and uh <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> yeah <SIL> yeah <SIL> she's nineteen <NOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
oh gosh a whole lot more people <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> whole lot more places to live seems like everywhere i turn there's construction and and <VOCNOISE> yknow you go down one one road and then you wait a couple years if you don't go in that area and <SIL> it's all changed <SIL> looks all different <VOCNOISE> so and that's mainly like looking at bethel <SIL> and <SIL> three fifteen north things like that <IVER>
yeah <SIL> think the population <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> in a way <SIL> but i think it also <SIL> leaves it open for all the things of <SIL> having too many people in one area <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> i don't i don't know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i've been home <SIL> i've been reading the paper a lot more and <VOCNOISE> yknow i'm more aware of what's going on and <VOCNOISE> i really um gonna be some kind of activist <SIL> for <LAUGH> um <VOCNOISE> i don't know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman's clubs and things like that i just i think that's gonna be really bad <SIL> for the kids and and everybody around <VOCNOISE> um there's one off of uh bethel <SIL> or no it's off of henderson cahoots <SIL> and then there's the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and <VOCNOISE> i couldn't even believe they're like right across the street from each other <VOCNOISE> yknow and <SIL> it's funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they <SIL> let all that stuff so <SIL> thinking it really affects it <NOISE> <SIL> yeah <SIL> try to go around <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <VOCNOISE> and until they make a women's uh club <LAUGH-so> <VOCNOISE> won't be real <LAUGH-equal> <LAUGH> <LAUGH-yeah> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
uh um <VOCNOISE> i'm sure that it has because it enables a lot more people to get housing and <SIL> and things like that <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> and i and yknow growth is always good my husband's in construction so i shouldn't be against it or anything but <VOCNOISE> um you kind of like to have things spread out and kind of yknow <SIL> have some space <SIL> so <IVER>
um <VOCNOISE> i work downtown <VOCNOISE> the last year i worked downtown and then i think about <SIL> oh probably fifteen twenty years ago i worked downtown <VOCNOISE> and um <VOCNOISE> yknow as far as the focus you mean like nighttime things or just anything in general or <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it's smaller compared to most downtowns <VOCNOISE> i mean you <SIL> yknow it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and you're out <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH-so> <VOCNOISE> i don't think it that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable <VOCNOISE> that would be nice <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> uh i live up north <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> around carl and <SIL> uh morse road <IVER>
<NOISE> so i have a house <IVER>
oh <NOISE> <IVER>
<NOISE> <CUTOFF-n=no?> <LAUGH-oh> then you wouldn't be too familiar with everything huh <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
northland mall <IVER>
yeah <SIL> with all the controversy about that and polaris and <VOCNOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> i don't know <CUTOFF-i=it's> it's <SIL> northland is such a <VOCNOISE> a good location for all the people around there and it's certainly not <SIL> yknow um <SIL> um <SIL> a hurting <CUTOFF-nei=neighborhood> or yknow a neighborhood that <VOCNOISE> people don't need <SIL> the shopping so i didn't see the difference of having both <SIL> there's lazarus everywhere there's sears everywhere why not have it both places <VOCNOISE> i mean i wouldn't particularly go up to polaris if they take northland <VOCNOISE> but we're not planning on staying there anyway so i didn't <SIL> yeah <SIL> we'll probably move within the year <SIL> um-hum <IVER>
um the well <SIL> i've had the house <VOCNOISE> excuse me <SIL> um <VOCNOISE> for probably six seven years and <VOCNOISE> we just need to move it's kind of small it's a smaller house <VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> my husband works in gahanna so we were gonna <SIL> look for some houses up that way and <VOCNOISE> maybe some land <VOCNOISE> we've been looking at some land <SIL> up north too <IVER>
um-hum <NOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> it's either gonna be find a house we want or we'll go build it <LAUGH-somewhere> <IVER>
oh <SIL> a place on some land <SIL> with <HES-some> woods and uh <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> water things like that <IVER>
<LAUGH-yeah> right <NOISE> yeah we could put a little trailer there we'd be outside most the time anyway so <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<NOISE> um-hum <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> yeah i would say anything outside <NOISE> like doing that <IVER>
<NOISE> um-hum <SIL> yeah <SIL> we'd like to garden <SIL> and that was one of the things too we want some space to <SIL> to make a bigger garden and <VOCNOISE> uh no <SIL> uh no we kind of help my neighbor out he's got a big garden next <LAUGH-door> <VOCNOISE> so we help him and <SIL> he's retired <VOCNOISE> oh <LAUGH> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <LAUGH-okay> good because i don't think i'd know that one <LAUGH> whatever looks pretty when it <LAUGH-comes_out>
