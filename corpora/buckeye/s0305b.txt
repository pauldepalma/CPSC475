<SIL> heard about that but <VOCNOISE> the same principle applies <VOCNOISE> but i'm talking about just every day things uh that uh <SIL> people who if you wanna talk <ERROR-atop=about> children primarily <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE> there is no penalty any more <VOCNOISE> uh parents are scared to death uh to pick up one up and spank them um with their bare hands or <VOCNOISE> or to make them stand in a corner because they considered <VOCNOISE> and i'm going back to the word harassment child abuse and harassment <VOCNOISE> of consequence um <VOCNOISE> and a <HES-hard> uh and penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply <VOCNOISE> look at janie and say janie <VOCNOISE> you should not do that <IVER>
and the stern expression or the expression on that face <VOCNOISE> <SIL> can be <SIL> equally effective as the smack oh on the bottom <VOCNOISE> oh with the bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be <VOCNOISE> i know that my the most effective penalty for me was my mother <VOCNOISE> uh would uh go out <VOCNOISE> near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder <VOCNOISE> and yeah it left marks <VOCNOISE> but <HES-it> and sure it hurt i mean it would sting <VOCNOISE> and i understood exactly what was meant and i think i grew up and i've ended up being i think a quite successful person i think my mother <VOCNOISE> had uh <VOCNOISE> uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty doggone decent kids <VOCNOISE> and none of us were injured none of us were hurt uh <VOCNOISE> and that was a basic method of <VOCNOISE> penalty <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ih=it> it wasn't something that <VOCNOISE> truly <CUTOFF-hur=hurt> injured <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> now today however <VOCNOISE> uh i suspect my mom could easily be <CUTOFF-ha=have> could have been charged with abuse in fact <VOCNOISE> child abuse <VOCNOISE> because it left a mark across my shoulder where that <VOCNOISE> uh <VOCNOISE> green <CUTOFF-swi=switch> it's always a green switch because uh uh the <HES-eh> old ones they would break you didn't want them break <LAUGH-break> <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> there was just something about that sting <VOCNOISE> far better far more than a paddle paddle was kind of a whop and then was end up with a sting and it kind of got your attention <SIL> and then you <CUTOFF-remem=remembered> <VOCNOISE> <NOISE> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> appeals appeals <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
