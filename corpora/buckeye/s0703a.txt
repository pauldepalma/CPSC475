<LAUGH> <LAUGH-I_can't_see_it> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<EXT-yeah> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
uh huh <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right <SIL> right <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
right <IVER>
oh what are you doing that for oh <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
that's funny <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> well see <VOCNOISE> we have real traditional <SIL> um <SIL> break down of <CUTOFF-t=?> of chores but only because <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-tha=that's> that's just happened to be <SIL> what we like to the way we like it do you know what i mean <VOCNOISE> and it's it's not <SIL> um <SIL> because <SIL> yknow i consider our <SIL> my whole house a lot of feminists yknow we're all real strong about that but the thing is <VOCNOISE> since i have the luxury of being at home <VOCNOISE> and peter <HES-is> doing a job that <VOCNOISE-he> really enjoys <VOCNOISE> and i am doing something i enjoy <VOCNOISE> i really am happy to do <VOCNOISE> all of those things that typically women do <VOCNOISE> because <NOISE> that's my job that's my trade off yknow i don't have to go someplace else i can get <VOCNOISE> i can go and have coffee everyday with my daughters i can go <CUTOFF-sh=shopping?> <SIL> <CUTOFF-y=yknow?> do whatever i want <VOCNOISE> and i'm happy to do these other things <IVER>
and so <VOCNOISE> yknow even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown <VOCNOISE> it's not <VOCNOISE> it's not because i <VOCNOISE-have> to <SIL> it's not because he yknow he wouldn't do something that that something else <SIL> it's <SIL> this suits me fine <IVER>
and so that's a whole different that's real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same <IVER>
right which is what we look like <IVER>
but it's not <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
um-hum <IVER>
right <IVER>
<CUTOFF-e=exactly> <IVER>
exactly <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
right <IVER>
i <SIL> <VOCNOISE> that's another thing that <SIL> that <SIL> we're i'm at odds with with my <VOCNOISE-parents> were that they don't understand the fact that why would i go to college <VOCNOISE> i <VOCNOISE-paid> for it myself <SIL> i worked my way through school <VOCNOISE> i was so proud the fact that i was like only a quarter late <SIL> <UNKNOWN> than my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was paying for it <SIL> as i went <VOCNOISE> and and i didn't have any loans i was when i was done it was <VOCNOISE-paid> for <VOCNOISE> and so um <VOCNOISE> course tuition was a hundred twenty five dollars a quarter but i was only making yknow fifty cents an hour at the beverly across the street on neil avenue <VOCNOISE> so um <VOCNOISE> <SIL> uh but <VOCNOISE-but> anyhow yknow they <VOCNOISE-could> never understand yknow well you <CUTOFF-di=didn't <SIL> you never got a job with it <SIL> yknow why would you go to school and waste all that money <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-=I> <SIL> i it was the best money i ever spent <IVER>
i don't <CUTOFF-under=understand> i mean and <SIL> it was my money <LAUGH-so> why should it matter <IVER>
right <SIL> well why do you have to do <SIL> anything with it <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
right but still <VOCNOISE> my <CUTOFF-j=name_Julie?> my oldest daughter were for a long time she was <ERROR-ith=in <SIL> in <VOCNOISE-theater> <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE-people> would say to me how do you feel about that and i said what do you mean how i feel about that <SIL> yknow <VOCNOISE> she can always wait tables as long as she can <VOCNOISE-support> herself <VOCNOISE> self what do i care <VOCNOISE> and then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology <VOCNOISE> and now as it turns out she's going to um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> she just started back she's the one that's having the baby though <VOCNOISE> she's just started back <CUTOFF-t=to> and uh <SIL> to get certified to teach elementary <SIL> school because we've <VOCNOISE> talked so much about <SIL> what <CUTOFF-whe=where?> where would she do well and she <VOCNOISE> she would just do so well she's really good <CUTOFF-wi=with> she's such a <VOCNOISE-kid> herself she's really good with with kids maybe second third grade she's so into animals and so into <VOCNOISE> science and understands different kids <VOCNOISE> so that <SIL> yknow i <VOCNOISE> i think she would be fabulous there <VOCNOISE> and so she's kind of decided <CUTOFF-i=if?> but if that if she <CUTOFF-j=just?> ends up not doing that <SIL> i won't care either <IVER>
well we don't wanna know she's the only one that wants to know her her um boyfriend <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-he> doesn't wanna know either and so sara decided that she could not go <VOCNOISE> and find out the sex of it because she couldn't keep a secret yeah so <VOCNOISE> so anyhow we don't we just don't know <IVER>
it's due december second but she's already dilating and everything so the doctor had said before thanksgiving he thinks yknow <IVER>
