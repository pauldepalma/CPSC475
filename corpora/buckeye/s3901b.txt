<SIL> of the medical school class which is two hundred twenty <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yeah i'll be starting in two thousand <SIL> three <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um <VOCNOISE> the first year they made it <SIL> in state only <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um second <SIL> and the second class that they're gonna be starting they have some people from michigan i think <IVER>
yknow they're just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it'll be something <SIL> a little more nationwide <SIL> but they really just wanted to start off with something easy <VOCNOISE> and um they only take national merit scholars in there <IVER>
so <SIL> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> national merit scholars also get full in state tuition <SIL> <IVER>
the <SIL> that's why it's mainly appealing to in state people you they pay you to go to school <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah that is one of the uh <IVER>
one of the <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> whether if it <SIL> it's a written goal or not that's what they're doing <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah it is <VOCNOISE> and <SIL> it seems to me that they don't keep the very very best of the kids <SIL> in state but it gets a lot of the <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> just below the absolute best in <SIL> it keeps a lot of them here <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> where they could go somewhere else <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> um i think <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <CUTOFF-ju=just> <SIL> just having like <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> such a low cost <CUTOFF-i=it> <SIL> really helps <SIL> <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
and um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> i don't know i think having just <CUTOFF-tha=that> having the word <SIL> honors gives it <SIL> some kids enough prestige that they don't <SIL> totally freak out about not going ivy league <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah parents are very into this um my sister <SIL> <VOCNOISE> has no idea where she wants to go but uh <VOCNOISE> they took me around to all the different colleges to be sure what i wanted <VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> they're just like <SIL> <EXCLUDE-name> go to o s u <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah well she went with us last time and <VOCNOISE> she liked some stuff but <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> i think she'll end up coming here anyway <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i went to <SIL> me see i applied to emory <VOCNOISE> harvard <VOCNOISE> duke <VOCNOISE> university of chicago and washington university <SIL> so <SIL> i got into three of those <SIL> and <SIL> they they were <SIL> neat places but <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> i know <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> oh <IVER>
definitely <IVER>
definitely i'm such a slacker here it's <LAUGH-great> <LAUGH> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> from what i hear actually the like the emory and the <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> <VOCNOISE> university of chicago you have to work really hard <VOCNOISE> because they get all the kids who wish they would have got into harvard and then start <SIL> yknow try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works <VOCNOISE> because they're like we already made it yknow <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i mean like it just <SIL> it provides an a <SIL> a window of opportunity for those who really do work like <IVER>
i know the valedictorian of harvard <VOCNOISE> like in the junior class i'm <IVER>
<SIL> she went to my school she just barely works at all apparently <IVER>
<SIL> yeah <SIL> like <IVER>
<SIL> nobody <SIL> oh she is really <SIL> plain smart i <LAUGH-mean> <IVER>
<SIL> but you don't <SIL> really have to work as hard there apparently <SIL> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i yeah that's <SIL> another thing i hear about <LAUGH-I_don't_know> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah i hear about suicide rates when you don't get in <LAUGH-in> <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
i uh i think <IVER>
<SIL> yeah i think i got really good uh um <VOCNOISE> i've actually been sitting thinking about it like what departments in school were good and which ones weren't <VOCNOISE> um <SIL> the foreign language is really good they have immersion classes from like at second level <IVER>
so i got into an immersion class here everybody else was freaking out and i was just used to it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
yknow <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um no english <IVER>
totally <VOCNOISE> like the directions and the homework <SIL> and everything is all <VOCNOISE> one hundred percent in german <IVER>
so it and we had like tapes we listened to of native speakers so <SIL> you <SIL> got <SIL> really good really quick <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> my <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> it was like freshman or sophomore year <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah um i took one oh four <SIL> during <VOCNOISE> <SIL> winter quarter <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> so that's all that they required i'm thinking about taking some extra anyway just because i like it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> that's why i started it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> now i just like it anyway and <SIL> i like their culture a lot <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> um i've been there twice already <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<SIL> yep <SIL> <IVER>
um both times <SIL> i stayed around this little town uh <VOCNOISE> it's like northwest of munich <SIL> so it's southern <VOCNOISE> um mossberg <SIL> <IVER>
<SIL> oh <VOCNOISE> you know of those areas <IVER>
oh okay <IVER>
<SIL> <VOCNOISE> yeah <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
yeah it was little had a little gymnasium in it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> <SIL> um well the first time i went officially with the exchange program the second time <VOCNOISE> i just went <VOCNOISE> and the exchange program happened to be there at the same time but i didn't go like under their insurance or on the same flight as them <VOCNOISE> i just kind of met up with them <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <VOCNOISE> it was more fun without being with <VOCNOISE> <SIL> <IVER>
without being with them <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah i could skip any program i wanted to <VOCNOISE> <SIL> yknow just show up at the parties basically <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um <IVER>
i like how everybody's just a little more relaxed about stuff <IVER>
yknow like uh work hard <VOCNOISE> <SIL> when you have to <IVER>
yknow which <SIL> when you should is a <SIL> better way of putting it <VOCNOISE> um <IVER>
<SIL> and then <SIL> when you don't take it easy <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> <SIL> yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during <SIL> lunch time because that's the big meal of day you go home and <SIL> eat with your family <SIL> that's <SIL> really important <IVER>
and then <SIL> um <SIL> like people who work go back <VOCNOISE> until like yknow maybe two to six <VOCNOISE> um the kids are done with school for the day at <SIL> like twelve one <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
um-hum <SIL> <IVER>
oh yeah yeah you work really hard while you're at it <VOCNOISE> and then when you're done you're done <SIL> <IVER>
yeah <SIL> <VOCNOISE> and they're less hyper about like <VOCNOISE> yknow <VOCNOISE> bad things for people to do yknow the the drinking the smoking there's not as <VOCNOISE> strict about it basically <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean you you kind of suffer your own consequences more <VOCNOISE> rather than having society like yell at you for it <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> no they don't actually <IVER>
um <SIL> it's kind of funny you're allowed to drink before you're allowed to drive <IVER>
so um <SIL> there's <VOCNOISE> from what i hear one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person and had quite an experience with it <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> i mean no crash or anything but <SIL> was <VOCNOISE> rather <SIL> scared <LAUGH> kind of shaken up by it but um <VOCNOISE> no they're <SIL> very very serious about designated drivers <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> and um <SIL> apparently when you're a car <SIL> um they have a very very <SIL> <VOCNOISE> like zero tolerance <IVER>
for alcohol <SIL> like on your breath at all <IVER>
yeah they do <VOCNOISE> their trains are so cool i love those <LAUGH> <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah they are <IVER>
yep <IVER>
<VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yep <IVER>
