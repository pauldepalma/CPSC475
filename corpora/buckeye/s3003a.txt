<VOCNOISE> you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so <VOCNOISE> i really don't know how to how <SIL> how they would go about doing that perhaps <VOCNOISE> like i know we used to have like uh <VOCNOISE> we had <SIL> like the administrators actually allowed us to have <VOCNOISE> ah <SIL> a day where <VOCNOISE> everyone like the whole class <VOCNOISE> as <VOCNOISE-a> class could go have a picnic <VOCNOISE> like in the practice football field and that was cool because <VOCNOISE> everyone got along those days <VOCNOISE-because> you didn't have to go to class you know you spent the second half the day <VOCNOISE-just> <VOCNOISE> hanging out and so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start <SIL> you know <VOCNOISE> but then <VOCNOISE> that hurts <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-f=?> <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-a=administration> <SIL> the administrators in a sense that <SIL> they're there to provide an <ERROR-edic=education> <SIL> education <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> it'd be rough <VOCNOISE> in like my high school <SIL> they <SIL> they put up <EXT-cameras> <VOCNOISE-and_they_had_like> <VOCNOISE> they locked <EXT-bathrooms> <VOCNOISE-like> at certain times you couldn't go in them and <VOCNOISE> like it was getting <SIL> and they had like we were on the front page the akron beacon journal <VOCNOISE> because they had a lock down where <VOCNOISE> no one was allowed to leave their classroom <VOCNOISE> and then <VOCNOISE> they brought this <VOCNOISE> the dogs <EXT-through> <VOCNOISE-and> <VOCNOISE> they found <SIL> i was surprised they found a lot of drugs <IVER>
and <SIL> i wasn't real <VOCNOISE> i was more surprised that they found a lot of <CUTOFF-l=like> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-like> <SIL> alcohol like i wouldn't <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> you know like some people <VOCNOISE> if they do drugs at school and stuff <VOCNOISE> i'm not saying that's right but <VOCNOISE> they'll <VOCNOISE> they'll do it but like <SIL> alcohol it'd be so hard to like hide because it <LAUGH-smells> you know and you <LAUGH-gotta> hold it out but they found like bottles of <EXT-liquor> and <VOCNOISE> <IVER>
stuff like that and i think they even might have found like one or two <VOCNOISE-guns> <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> and that to me was <VOCNOISE> <SIL> but my high school is two thousand people so i guess <VOCNOISE> by sheer numbers <VOCNOISE> one or two persons would bring a gun <IVER>
um <SIL> it's considered <VOCNOISE> urban <VOCNOISE> but because it's north of akron we play <VOCNOISE-like> <VOCNOISE> a lot of like <VOCNOISE> the <SIL> inner city like in akron schools <VOCNOISE> but in my opinion it's suburbia <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> but we have the we have the big city problems like <VOCNOISE> there's a lot <UNKNOWN> drugs <SIL> and <CUTOFF-i=it> i think that's just because <VOCNOISE> the building's old so no one really takes pride <VOCNOISE-in> it <VOCNOISE> and then <SIL> it's two <VOCNOISE-thousand> people <IVER>
so that <VOCNOISE> like the just the sheer numbers of it i think <IVER>
i <CUTOFF-thi=think> i <HES-would> like if you had to ask i'd say i was a straight <CUTOFF-m=mid> mid western suburbanite <SIL> but <VOCNOISE> there are people that i go to school with <VOCNOISE> and ashland is twenty five thousand <VOCNOISE> like <SIL> in the city <IVER>
and they <VOCNOISE> they say that's a city <SIL> and <VOCNOISE> my school <VOCNOISE> or <CUTOFF-m=my> <VOCNOISE> where i grew up was <VOCNOISE> more than double that <SIL> just over double that it was like sixty thousand <IVER>
and <IVER>
cuyahoga falls <IVER>
and to me that's considered suburbia <VOCNOISE> so <VOCNOISE> and to me ashland is considered the sticks i mean <VOCNOISE> there's <CUTOFF-peop=people> there's amish buggies that go by <IVER>
but like to some people that's considered a city so i think it's you're perspective <VOCNOISE-in_that> sense <IVER>
for fun <VOCNOISE> we've been playing a lot of pool <IVER>
a <LAUGH-lot_of> pool <SIL> actually <VOCNOISE> uh we go to a bar <VOCNOISE> called the out-r-inn <SIL> because it's cheap and <SIL> it's fun there <IVER>
uh <VOCNOISE> out-r-inn <VOCNOISE> is over <VOCNOISE> i don't even know <LAUGH-like> <IVER>
<LAUGH> i know how to get to it like the way we walk but i don't know what street its on <IVER>
yeah it's real <CUTOFF-wa=walking> it's like the one of the closest bars and we go there because they have a huge patio <VOCNOISE> and so you can just sit out and <VOCNOISE> talk and <VOCNOISE> and then uh we play a lot of board games lately too <VOCNOISE> like we just bought axis and allies me and my roommates <IVER>
so it's really weird because uh <IVER>
it's it's kind of a fun game <SIL> it's just strange because <VOCNOISE> uh <SIL> like <SIL> we're on <CUTOFF-se=semesters> <VOCNOISE> i came down in semesters so there was still a month <VOCNOISE> where everyone was down here <SIL> and now there's like <VOCNOISE> nobody down here so it's <VOCNOISE> myself <VOCNOISE> my two roommates and maybe <SIL> a handful of like <VOCNOISE> other people that we know <VOCNOISE> so it like <VOCNOISE> the social aspects like <SIL> is <VOCNOISE> has diminished a lot <VOCNOISE> but that still i mean for fun we uh <VOCNOISE> play a lot of video games do like i guess you'd think <ERROR-thike=like> the natural <VOCNOISE> like <VOCNOISE> things you would expect from a college guy <IVER>
go out <IVER>
try and hit on girls that doesn't work that type of <LAUGH-thing> <IVER>
yeah just get out there and have fun <VOCNOISE> and then like we lift <VOCNOISE> uh probably like four days a week i know i don't look like it but <LAUGH> <VOCNOISE> but i go with them and have a <VOCNOISE-good> time <VOCNOISE> so <IVER>
yeah yeah it's uh right around here like <VOCNOISE-yeah> <IVER>
it's like down the hill kind of by the <CUTOFF-horsesh=horseshoe> <VOCNOISE> yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah so that's where we go <VOCNOISE> and <VOCNOISE> i don't have a student i d so i just sneak in but it's the summer they don't even care <VOCNOISE> they never <IVER>
i look like a college student that would go here so <VOCNOISE> i've never had a problem <VOCNOISE> so we go and <VOCNOISE-do> that <VOCNOISE> and like we're planning a road trip we're <VOCNOISE> we <VOCNOISE> we're not we haven't decided we're thinking atlantic city <VOCNOISE> or uh <SIL> florida <VOCNOISE> or new york city <SIL> <VOCNOISE-or> <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-n=new> <SIL> new orleans those the choices we're trying to narrow it down <IVER>
i know <LAUGH-those_are> <EXT-hauls> <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE-but> <SIL> you know <IVER>
when else <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-ih=at> <CUTOFF-ih=at> <SIL> at this point in my life when else would i be able to do <VOCNOISE-it> so <IVER>
<LAUGH> <SIL> <IVER>
uh maybe <VOCNOISE> maybe i like i said like <VOCNOISE> it's really weird <VOCNOISE> <CUTOFF-em=most> most people make fun of me for still wearing detroit hats and being a detroit fan because i've lived in ohio for so long <VOCNOISE> but <VOCNOISE> when you're little is when <CUTOFF-yih=you> <VOCNOISE> i think you learn loyalty like i love the <SIL> old detroit tigers from the eighties <VOCNOISE> and like <VOCNOISE> that's when i learned <VOCNOISE> to like <IVER>
baseball like i collected baseball cards <VOCNOISE> i lived in detroit and so that's why it like stuck with me <VOCNOISE> so like i uh i remember when i had my tonsils out <SIL> in third grade like you're allowed to bring one item because like you're a little kid <VOCNOISE> to like make you feel better <VOCNOISE> and i brought my detroit tigers hat so <NOISE-like> <NOISE> <LAUGH-and_like> i i <CUTOFF-owul=only> like i'll only wear detroit or boston and boston just because i <CUTOFF-l=lived> <VOCNOISE> <VOCNOISE-I> uh was born there <VOCNOISE> but <SIL> and like people make fun of me they're like you know because detroit's horrible they're in last place <IVER>
they're like why don't you pitch <VOCNOISE> you know be happy for the indians i'm like i'm <VOCNOISE-happy> for them that's fine but <IVER>
oh yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
oh you get your <LAUGH-choice_kind_of> <SIL> well that's <IVER>
yeah yeah <LAUGH> equal distance <IVER>
<LAUGH> they're definitely <VOCNOISE> i thought they'd be a lot <VOCNOISE-better> <VOCNOISE> they got they picked up <VOCNOISE> ken griffey and then on top of it <VOCNOISE> they <CUTOFF-we=were> <CUTOFF-ha=had> they were good without him <VOCNOISE> and now they picked him up and they seem to be <CUTOFF-doi=doing> they still struggling i'm like <VOCNOISE> i don't understand that <SIL> yeah but the indians are horrible right now <SIL> i like i watched a game yesterday <VOCNOISE> and <NOISE> they were <CUTOFF-s=?> <VOCNOISE> i think they were few days ago seven and a half games back from the chicago whitesox <VOCNOISE> we watched the game yesterday and <VOCNOISE> i don't know if we have a lot of injuries or anything <VOCNOISE-because> i don't really follow the indians but <VOCNOISE> the <CUTOFF-a=I> like i couldn't even recognize like that many of the names <IVER>
like <VOCNOISE> to me that was very strange <IVER>
yeah <LAUGH> that's that's pretty much out there <IVER>
yeah they definitely have the sticks <VOCNOISE> definitely <SIL> yeah they <VOCNOISE> the <VOCNOISE> the big sticks are definitely <SIL> <VOCNOISE-on> those two teams <IVER>
it seems that way i don't know why that is <VOCNOISE> you know in the eighties <VOCNOISE> they had <VOCNOISE> a lot of games were like <VOCNOISE> one to two <SIL> you know <UNKNOWN> shut-outs stuff like that <VOCNOISE> now i mean <VOCNOISE> he <VOCNOISE> my roommate was telling me the yankees beat someone twenty one to something the other day <IVER>
and that's ridiculous <SIL> that's <LAUGH-amazing> to me <IVER>
i know yeah i know it's ridiculous i'm just <VOCNOISE> i find that just <VOCNOISE-crazy> <IVER>
yeah it dilutes <VOCNOISE> there's there's only so much talent so it dilutes it <IVER>
and that that makes sense <SIL> and a lot of the new ballparks are made smaller <VOCNOISE> so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts <VOCNOISE> people would rather see a <VOCNOISE> tight game that was like <VOCNOISE> seven to like six <VOCNOISE> rather than watch like uh <VOCNOISE> a two to one ball game <IVER>
because that's more boring <IVER>
yeah <VOCNOISE> yeah <IVER>
yeah yeah exactly last three outs everyone's like yeah let's hope he does it but until then you're like <VOCNOISE> okay this is ridiculous <IVER>
yeah <IVER>
<LAUGH> <IVER>
all right <IVER>
no <VOCNOISE> no i think <LAUGH-I'm_all_right> <IVER>
<EXCLUDE-no_not_at_all> <NOISE> <IVER>
